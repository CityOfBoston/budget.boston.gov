      The surplus property disposition fund contains the proceeds from 
      the sale of various City land or buildings. The use of these funds 
      is usually restricted to one-time expenditures.
    description: >
      The FY17 budget included a one-time transfer of $4 million from 
      the surplus property disposition fund to the Boston Housing Authority. 
      No funds are included in the FY18 Budget from this revenue source.

      <h5>Budgetary Fund Balance</h5>
      <p>Budgetary Fund Balance can be appropriated for use during the fiscal 
      year after certification by the DOR. Budgetary Fund Balance is more commonly 
      referred to as “Free Cash” when used this way. This item is most simply 
      described as the portion of available reserves, generated to a considerable 
      degree by annual operating surpluses, which the City can responsibly 
      appropriate for spending.</p>

      <h5>Using recurring revenue</h5>
      <p>The FY15 and FY16 budget did not use any fund balance, instead using 
      recurring revenue to support the appropriation for Other Post-employment 
      Benefits (OPEB), the liability associated with retiree health insurance costs. 
      The FY17 and FY18 budget assume the use of $40.0 million to support OPEB.</p>
