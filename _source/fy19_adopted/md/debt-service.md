        The City benefits from its strong financial policies and practices. In February 2017, Boston's
        triple A bond rating was affirmed by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s. Strong bond        
        ratings are an assessment of the City’s long-term financial stability and lower the cost 
        of borrowing. <blockquote>As the City borrows more over ten years to support investments 
        in its schools, debt service is projected to increase as well. In FY19 Debt Service is 
        budgeted at $190.2 million, a 4.4% increase over the previous year. </blockquote> For
