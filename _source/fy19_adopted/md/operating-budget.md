      <h5>Revenue</h5>
      <p>Local sources continue to drive revenue growth in FY19, as property tax and local receipts make up 97% of revenue growth over FY18. While the City is expected to experience continued robust property tax growth in FY19, overall revenue growth is expected to be hampered by sluggish state revenue growth. State revenue, the City’s second largest revenue source, never recovered following the last recession, and in FY19, Boston’s state revenue is budgeted to only grow at 1.0% over FY18.  Net State Aid (state aid net of assessments) is budgeted to decline as continued increases in state assessments for charter school tuition outpace stagnant budgeted state revenue.

      <h5>Expenditures</h5>
      On the expenditure side, the FY19 budget reflects an increase of $138.5 million or 4.4% over the FY18 budget.  Of that growth, 27% is dedicated to education, including Boston Public Schools (BPS) and Charter School Tuition Assessment, and 31% will go to all other city services, such as Police, Fire, and Public Works, and the Public Health Commission. 22% of the growth comes from estimated employee wage increases in the collective bargaining reserve that will ultimately be transferred to education or city services and the remaining 20% of the growth will be consumed by pension, debt service and other fixed cost expenditures.

      Expenditures are broken down into two primary groups: (1) appropriations directly related to departmental services and (2) fixed and mandated costs. FY19 appropriations are subdivided into three subgroups as follows:
      <ul>
      <li>City Appropriations, which includes all operating department 
      appropriations, centrally budgeted costs such as health insurance and 
      Medicare, a risk retention reserve and a set-aside for tax title and annual audit expenses;</li>
      <li>Boston Public Health Commission (PHC), the City appropriation for the quasi-independent authority and successor to the Department of Health and Hospitals;</li>
      <li>and School Department, the City appropriation for the Boston Public 
      Schools (BPS).</li>
      </ul>
      Appropriations are also presented by expenditure category across the three subgroups. (Figure 6)

        <p>Personnel Services include salaries, overtime, unemployment compensation and 
        workers’ compensation, and collective bargaining reserves for estimated wage 
        increases for union employees whose agreements are not settled. The majority of departments had employees who reached agreement on collective bargaining contracts, so department growth reflects those wage and cost of living increases, while outstanding contracts are reserved centrally.</p>
