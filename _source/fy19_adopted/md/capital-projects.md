  - title: What Are Capital Projects?
    body: >
      The City is responsible for maintaining a large inventory of capital assets,
      including roads, bridges, schools, parks, libraries, public safety equipment,
      city buildings and more. The City’s capital investments enhance our neighborhoods,
      improve mobility, support the academic agenda of our schools and reinforce public
      safety with quality emergency response tools.

  - col: >
      <p>With Imagine Boston 2030 and other City Planning efforts guiding many of
      the investments in this plan, projects in the FY19-23 Capital Plan are categorized
      within the Imagine Boston 2030 initiatives below.</p>
  - col: >
      <p>These capital investments are planned and funded through the City’s capital
      budget, which is separate and distinct from the annual operating budget. The
      capital plan is primarily funded by borrowing through the issuance of bonds within
      the City’s fiscally responsible debt affordability limits.</p>

  - title: Imagine Boston 2030
    body: >
      Mayor Walsh’s $2.4 billion Imagine Boston FY19-23 capital plan will make critical 
      investments in the City’s infrastructure in every Boston neighborhood, guided by
      Imagine Boston 2030 and the schools, streets, arts, climate and resilience plans 
      under its umbrella. <blockquote>More than 14,000 residents have shaped Imagine Boston
      2030 by articulating the challenges Boston faces, setting goals for the city in 2030, 
      and generating ideas about policies and investments to help achieve these goals.</blockquote>
      <h5>Ambitious initiatives</h5>
      <p>An ambitious set of initiatives form the foundation of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan. Taken together, these initiatives will support Boston's dynamic economy and improve quality of life for residents by:
      <ul>
      <li>Encouraging affordability;</li>
      <li>Increasing access to opportunity;</li>
      <li>Promoting a healthy environment; and</li>
      <li>Guiding investment in the public realm</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Imagine Boston Capital Plan</h5>
      <p>Last Year, Mayor Walsh launched the Imagine Boston Capital Plan to move
        Boston residents’ priorities from idea to action, and invest in creating the
        city Bostonians imagine for the future. This year, under the Imagine Boston 2030 umbrella,
        the City is investing deeply in the core goals of BuildBPS, Go Boston 2030,
        Boston Creates, and Climate Ready Boston. An estimated 85% of the investment
        in the FY19-23 Capital Plan is aligned with the City’s planning efforts:</p>

      <h5>Moving into the 21st century</h5>
      <p>Mayor Walsh committed $1 billion over ten years to bring Boston's school
      buildings into the 21st century, and this Capital Plan launches that investment
      with funding for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>21st century classrooms;</li>
          <li>MSBA Accelerated Repair Program partnerships;</li>
          <li>Completion of projects in the pipeline;</li>
          <li>School kitchen renovations that support the delivery of fresh, nutritious food; and</li>
          <li>Reserves for future projects identified by BuildBPS community
          engagement.</li>
        </ul>
      <h5>Core initiatives</h5>
      <p>Boston, in collaboration with State and Federal sources, will invest $967
      million over the next five years in implementing the core initiatives outlined
      in Go Boston 2030:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Streets that are safer for all users of our roads and sidewalks,
          particularly pedestrians and cyclists;</li>
          <li>Travel that is more reliable and predictable; and</li>
          <li>Quality transportation choices that improve access to interconnect our
          neighborhoods for all modes of travel.</li>
        </ul>
      <h5>Open Space goals</h5>
      <p>Through the use of Winthrop Square proceeds, City capital dollars, and leveraging
      external funds, Mayor Walsh plans to carry out early actions to implement Imagine
      Boston 2030’s Open Space goals, including investing in Franklin Park as a keystone
      park for the city, completing the Emerald Necklace, and restoring Boston Common to
      its full vibrancy.</p>
      <h5>Preparing for climate change</h5>
      <p>Boston will prepare for climate change by investing City capital dollars and external funding
      to develop more detailed climate plans for Boston neighborhoods, especially those most
      at risk for coastal flooding, as recommended in Climate Ready Boston.</p>
      <h5>Percent for Art Program</h5>
      <p>The Percent for Art Program demonstrates the City’s leadership and commitment to
      sustainable funding for the arts by setting aside one percent of the City’s annual capital
      borrowing for the commissioning of public art.</p>

  - title: FY19 Expenditures Allocation
    body: >
      The City estimates FY19 capital expenditures from all sources will total $337.9 million
      from all sources. All projects in the capital plan are categorized as
      Upkeep, Upgrade, New/Major Renovation, Planning, or Matching Funds. The City tracks
      the overall distribution of these categories to maintain a balance between the
      upkeep of existing assets and the expansion or introduction of new ones.
- text_col_2:
  - col:
    - img: /img/capital-expenditures.png
  - col: >
      <h5>Upkeep</h5>
      <p>Upkeep represents projects that maintain the City’s assets, a fundamental priority of the Capital Plan. In FY19, 22% of projected spending supports Upkeep projects. These include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Roof and masonry repairs;</li>
      <li>Replacement of play equipment in parks;</li>
      <li>HVAC and boiler replacement; and</li>
      <li>Critical repair funds for departments to address relatively small but vital repair projects not covered by routine maintenance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A substantial portion of the Upkeep category supports on-going bridge, street,
      sidewalk, and street lighting repairs that ensure the City’s roads and sidewalks
      are safe and in good condition.</p>
- text_col_2:
  - col: >
      <h5>Upgrade</h5>
      <p>Upgrade represents projects that improve existing assets by adding new capacity
      or innovations. This year’s upgrade allocations account for 38% of projected spending,
      and includes projects such as Connect Historic Boston – the redesign of several Downtown
      streets with support from a Federal grant – and new equipment for the police radio
      system.</p>
  - col: >      
      <h5>New/Major Renovations</h5>
      <p>New/Major Renovations represents 34% of the FY19 allocations. New facilities and
      rehabilitation projects for schools, libraries, parks and community centers enable
      the City’s facilities to adapt to fit the needs of today’s programs, improve the ‘green’
      performance of facilities, and extend the useful life of older assets. Highlights in
      this category include a new fire house at Engine 42 in Roxbury and BCYF Curley Community
      Center in South Boston.</p>
- text_col_2:
  - col: >
      <h5>Planning or Matching Funds</h5>
      <p>About 1% of the FY19 budget is assigned to matching fund requirements and to
      planning projects. Comprehensive planning projects, which analyze a group of buildings or
      program needs, provide the groundwork for targeted investments in the categories of Upgrade
      and New/Major Renovations.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Other projects</h5>
      <p>The Matching fund category includes projects where the City covers the cost of design
      and engineering services.  These expenditures are able to leverage state and federal
      construction funds on projects such as the new North Washington Street Bridge and the
      South Bay Harbor Trail.</p>
