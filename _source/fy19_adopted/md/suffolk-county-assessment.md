      The Suffolk County budget is a fixed cost mandated by state legislation, 
      budgeted at $3.9 million in FY19. State legislation converted all existing 
      and future Suffolk County Sheriff employees to state employees effective 
      January 1, 2010.
    description: >
      The State charges the City for Suffolk County through an assessment based 
      on the residual unfunded pension liability for former Sherriff employees who 
      retired prior to January 1, 2010. <blockquote>Once the unfunded pension liability is 
      fully extinguished, the budget for Suffolk County will no longer be 
      necessary.</blockquote>
