      <h5>School Department</h5>
      <p>The School Department increased by 223.6 FTEs.  The continued focus on inclusion classrooms is apparent with an increase of 29 inclusion teachers and 53 aides.

      <h5>Public Safety Cabinet</h5>
      <p>Although city funded FTEs in the Public Safety Cabinet decreased by 58.8, this is due to an administrative re-coding in May 2017 of School Traffic Supervisors in the Police department from 1 FTE each to .41 each.  Thus, the Police Department reflects a January to January decrease of 92 FTEs, even though the number of employees remained steady. The Fire Department had an increase of 33, which reflects the 75 SAFER grant funded firefighters that came onto the operating fund in September 2017 offset by regular attrition. The Fire Department’s FY18 replacement class was in February 2018.</p>

  - title: FY19 Projected FTE Changes
    body: >
      The City projects a net increase in FTE levels of 220.7 from January 1, 2018 to January 1, 2019. The majority of the growth is targeted in the priority areas of education, public safety, and transportation.

      <h5>Education Cabinet</h5>
      <p>A significant portion of the projected growth in filled FTEs from January 2018 to January 2019 is in the Education Cabinet.

      <h5>Public Safety</h5>
      <p>Historically, the number of Public Safety employees on the payroll as of January 1 of any year 
      has fluctuated with the timing of retirements and new classes. In FY19 the projected January to January increase in the Fire Department is due to the timing of the FY19 class in fall 2018 as opposed to the FY18 class which came on in spring 2018. The goal of the department is to have enough firefighters in the suppression force to cover the minimum manning level of 262 and to reduce overtime.
