  - title: Creating and Preserving Affordable Housing for All Income Levels
    body: >
      <p>More than 26,000 new housing units have already been completed or are currently in construction, and another 26,000 are under review. This represents 98 percent of the City’s 53,000-unit target for 2030.</p>
      <p>Next year, the Department of Neighborhood Development (DND) will double its down payment assistance program to $1 million, allowing dozens of middle class families to access zero-interest loans to cover down payments.  This $500,000 increase will promote homeownership among moderate and middle income homebuyers in Boston.</p>
      <p>DND will also leverage non-operating budget revenue sources, such as Inclusionary Development Program funds and Linkage funds administered through the Neighborhood Housing Trust. DND will use these revenue sources to continue the Acquisition Opportunity Program and Neighborhood Homes Initiative, which are creating more affordable rental and homeownership opportunities in Boston.</p>

  - title: Preventing Displacement and Preserving Tenancy
    body: >
      <p>As Boston grows, it is important that it grows equitably and prevents the displacement of long term residents. In FY17, Mayor Walsh created the Office of Housing Stability to support renters in housing crisis, preserve tenancy, and prevent displacement. The FY19 budget expands the capacity and effectiveness of that office with new investments:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>$150,000 for flexible financial assistance for low and moderate income households facing a housing crisis.</li>
      <li>$125,000 for expanded legal representation and stabilization services for renters facing eviction.</li>
      <li>Funding for an additional case manager to support renters facing housing crisis and provide information to tenants and landlords about their rights and responsibilities.</li>
      <li>$35,000 increase for the Emergency Housing Assistance Program to assist residents displaced by fire, condemnation, natural disaster and other events.</li>
      <li>Additional staff at the Elderly Commission to support tenant or home-owning seniors who face issues including foreclosures, evictions, or utility problems.</li>
      </ul>

  - title: Implementing Boston’s Homeless Action Plan
    body: >
      <p>With the 2015 publication of <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/neighborhood-development/bostons-way-home">Boston’s Way Home</a>, the City’s plan to end chronic and veteran homelessness, Mayor Walsh reinforced the City’s commitment to the most vulnerable populations in our community. Boston’s Way Home calls for a single, integrated homeless system, which will not only quickly move homeless individuals from Boston's streets and shelters into permanent housing, but also provide them the support they need to remain stable.</p> 
      <p>As part of the Boston’s Way Home initiative, Boston has housed over 900 homeless veterans since July 2014, and put an end to chronic veteran homelessness in Boston. In addition, since January of 2016, Boston and our partners have housed over 480 chronically homeless individuals.</p> 
      <p>Mayor Walsh also announced the creation of the Boston’s Way Home fund in 2018. This fund will raise $10 million in private donations over the course of four years to create 200 new units of supportive, sustainable, long-term housing for chronically homeless men and women. As of March 2018, the fund had already received over $3 million in contributions.</p>
