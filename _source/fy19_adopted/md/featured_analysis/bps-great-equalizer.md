      A cornerstone of Mayor Walshâ€™s FY19 budget is the investment in public education. Since taking office, Mayor Walsh has increased spending by $261 million, and results are showing. Graduation rates are at a historic high and Boston Public Schools has more high performing schools than ever before.
    description: >
      Overall, the BPS budget is increasing by $51 million next year. $40 million of that funding will go directly to schools where principals, teachers, and staff can respond to the needs of their students. This is almost a 6% increase in funding directed to schools. Despite flat enrollment district-wide, the vast majority of schools will see increases in their budgets.
