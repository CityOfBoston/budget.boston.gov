      The City’s $3.29 billion operating budget is supplemented by 
      approximately $350 million in external funds. These funds consist 
      mainly of federal, state, and private funding earmarked for specific 
      purposes. 
    description: >
      Education, housing, economic development, public health and public 
      safety are some of the largest areas for which these funds are targeted.

      <h5>Departments and external funding</h5>
      <p>Twenty-six departments and agencies expect to receive federal, state or other forms of external funding in FY19. Over 92% of the City’s external funds are found in eight of those twenty-six departments. These eight departments are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Boston Public Schools;</li>
      <li>Neighborhood Development;</li>
      <li>Public Health Commission;</li>
      <li>Treasury Department;</li>
      <li>Emergency Management;</li>
      <li>Police;</li>
      <li>Library; and</li>
      <li>the Elderly Commission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other departments that also have significant grant funding are the Office of Economic Development and the Fire Department. Descriptions and amounts of grants by department can be found on department pages.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Federal grants</h5>
      <p>Federal grants have historically provided funding for key City priorities for education, community development, and services for seniors. Boston Public Schools, the Department of Neighborhood Development (DND), and the Elderly Commission have been the traditional recipients of recurring entitlement grants provided by the federal government.</p>
      <h5>Proposed federal budget cuts</h5>
      <p>Although proposed federal budget cuts open questions about future levels of funding for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnership, this budget assumes that DND will continue to receive these recurring federal entitlement grants, which provide funding for a variety of neighborhood development activities. The City will advocate that these critical programs are maintained in the federal budget. Other sources of federal funding received by the City are used to address diverse needs and/or creative approaches for homeland security, community policing and housing support for the homeless.</p>
