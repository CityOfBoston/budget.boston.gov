    body: >
      <p>Mayor Walsh released Go Boston 2030 in March 2017 to push Boston for streets and sidewalks that are safer, travel that is more    reliable and predictable, and quality transportation choices that improve access and interconnect our neighborhoods for all modes of travel. Driven by these core goals of safety, reliability, equity and access, Mayor Walshâ€™s FY19 operating and FY19-FY23 capital budget dedicates transformational funding for transportation projects. By increasing certain parking fines in FY19, the City will produce positive results by changing driver behavior and reducing congestion in high traffic areas, as well as allow the City to make $5 million in signature investments in transportation projects.</p>
      <h5>Investing in Streets & Signals</h5>
      <p>A portion of the $5 million investment is focused on improving the basics of the City's 800 miles of streets, 1,600 miles of sidewalks, and over 800 traffic signals, including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>$2 million increase in investment for roadway resurfacing and sidewalk repairs.</li>
      <li>$150,000 for stormwater interventions on our roadways to better manage high precipitation events.</li>
      <li>One new traffic signal engineer to manage and retime traffic signals to increase safety, and reduce traffic congestion and related vehicle emissions.
      <li>Two new traffic signal mechanics to keep signals working as designed.</li>
      </ul>  
      <h5>Increasing Safety for Walking & Biking</h5>
      <p>The top priority in Go Boston 2030 is increasing safety on our streets. As part of this recommended budget, the City proposes a series of investments to accelerate our ability to deliver on that priority, including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>An additional $750,000 for the Walkable Streets program, nearly doubling the City's investment in building out a better pedestrian network.</li>
      <li>$400,000 for the Green Links program, a new dedicated source of funding for filling missing bike and pedestrian connections to parks and paths.</li>
      <li>An additional $300,000 for the strategic bike network program, raising the annual investment to $1.2 million for building out high quality bike infrastructure in Boston.</li>
      <li>Two new planners and two new engineers to focus on designing and implementing key Vision Zero programs.</li>
      <li>Four new maintenance and operations personnel to ensure that infrastructure added to improve street safety are kept in a state of good repair.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Strengthening Bus Transit</h5>
      <p>Through the recommended budget, the City will launch its first "Transit Team", designated to work with the MBTA to improve public transit, with a particular focus on bus service, which services 350,000 trips each day. The transit team is expected to include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A transit coordinator and an additional staff person to design bus lanes and implement transit signal improvements.</li>
      <li>Four operations staff focused on managing dedicated bus lanes in the City of Boston.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Significant investments in City-owned bridges</h5>
      <p>The FY19-FY23 capital plan will also make significant investments in City-owned bridges. These vital connections allow people and commerce to move about the city, and replacing or upgrading keeps Boston moving. Bridge Projects in FY19 include:</p> 
      <ul>
      <li>The replacement of the North Washington Street Bridge</li>
      <li>The Long Island Bridge project</li>
      <li>Northern Avenue Bridge</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Creating opportunities for older adults to engage in activities throughout the community</h5>
      <p>The Public Works Department will purchase and install 45 new benches in neighborhoods around the city. Benches not only improve the practical walkability of a neighborhood, they provide a public amenity that enhances local streetscapes and enables people to come together.</p>
