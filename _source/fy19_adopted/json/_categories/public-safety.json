    "As part of the Imagine Boston 2030 initiative to reduce cancer risks for firefighters, the Capital Plan includes health and safety improvements to firehouse projects. The Fire Department, in conjunction with the Public Facilities Department, studied best practices for firehouse design and will now utilize an enhanced set of building programs for new and renovated firehouses. Key changes include separating areas of the firehouse to prevent contamination of living areas, and improves personal and gear cleaning facilities. The new stations for Engine 42 and Engine 17 will be among the first firehouses in the nation to reflect these enhancements. The City is also renovating neighborhood existing fire and police stations. In East Boston, construction is expected to begin on a new police station, a $29.9 million project that will replace the existing A-7 station.",
    "In 2016, the City launched an accelerated fire apparatus replacement plan, which will replace nearly 50 percent of the fleet by the end of 2019. In FY17, the department purchased 16 new fire trucks to replace a series of apparatus with known mechanical issues and improve public safety by increasing the number of apparatus in the reserve fleet. In FY18, the Fire Department purchased nine pumper trucks, three ladders, and one tower ladder. The plan will continue with the purchase of three pumpers, three ladder trucks, and one tower ladder in FY19.",
    "The Police Department is upgrading and replacing its radio system to support our police officers. The project will include $56 million in operating and capital investments over four years. To research future radio needs for other public safety and civilian departments, DoIT will continue a feasibility study to determine the most cost effective and efficient way to expand and sustain the infrastructure that supports the radio systems of multiple City departments."
