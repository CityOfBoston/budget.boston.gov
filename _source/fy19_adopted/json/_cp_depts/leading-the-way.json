  "mission":[
    "The mission of the Leading the Way (LTW) campaign was to expand and protect Boston&rsquo;s housing supply and stabilize neighborhoods adversely affected by the economic downturn and foreclosure boom. The campaign focused all of the City&rsquo;s housing agencies around a strategy to address Boston&rsquo;s housing needs in four key areas: 1) Housing Boston&rsquo;s workforce through new production and enhanced access to the market; 2) Preventing foreclosures and mitigating the negative effects of foreclosures on Boston&rsquo;s neighborhoods; 3) Reversing the rise in homelessness, and 4) Preserving and stabilizing the rental housing stock. In 2014, Mayor Walsh announced his Boston 2030 plan which outlines a new comprehensive approach to accommodating Boston's complex housing needs over the next 15 years. Funding committed for the new plan has been renamed the &ldquo;Housing 2030 Fund&rdquo; which is now included under the Neighborhood Development Operating Budget in \"Program 3: Housing Development and Services.\""
