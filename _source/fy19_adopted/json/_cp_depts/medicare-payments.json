    "The Medicare Payments appropriation supports federal regulations that extend mandatory Medicare coverage to municipal employees. Federal law requires the City of Boston and County of Suffolk to pay the Social Security Trust Fund a Medicare insurance premium amounting to 1.45% of an employee's salary up to $125,000 for each employee hired after March 31, 1986. The Medicare Payments appropriation reflects the amount of this contribution. The City's payment is matched by an equal contribution from the employee."
