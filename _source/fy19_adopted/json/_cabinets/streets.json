  "overview":[
    "The overall Streets Cabinet budget will increase by 3.9% in FY19. This increase reflects transformational investments in the future of Boston&rsquo;s transportation landscape. These various transportation investments along with capital funding will make significant progress on implementing Go Boston 2030 projects. ",
    "In FY19, the Transportation Department will see an increase of 7.5% with new investments in various transportation projects in neighborhoods and city wide and increased personnel costs related to collective bargaining. Through updating the City&rsquo;s parking fines, aiming to change drivers&rsquo; behavior and reduce congestion in high traffic areas, the City will be able to make significant investments in transportation projects throughout the City. These investments include better managing traffic signals to increase safety and reduce congestion, additional funding for Vision Zero to build 15 slow streets, 15 miles of protected bike lanes and fix 15 of the most challenging intersections in the next four years, and establishing a City&rsquo;s transit team to better coordinate with the MBTA. In addition, Boston is continuing its citywide, multi-year campaign to bring all crosswalks, lane markings, and bike lanes into a state of good repair. The Department will continue to see savings in FY19 from reforms to reduce overtime and eliminate long-term vacant positions, as well as a tightened utility budget.",
    "The Public Works Department&rsquo;s FY19 budget will be 1.6% above the FY18 budget with increased personnel costs related to collective bargaining. In an effort to improve the safety and comfort of the City&rsquo;s public spaces and create more opportunities for older adults to fully engage in activities throughout the community, the Public Works Department will purchase and install 45 new benches in neighborhoods around the City. The FY19 budget includes a new investment to explore short term interventions to address storm water issues in the City. The Public Works Department will also purchase two new large street sweepers to be operated by City staff and achieve savings by reducing reliance on outside street sweeping contractors. Savings are also expected from the elimination of long-term vacant position and pursuing overtime reduction targets."
