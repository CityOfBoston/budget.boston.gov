  "mission":[
    "The mission of the Economic Development Cabinet is to lead a broad effort to streamline and support areas of focus that contribute to Boston&rsquo;s economy including tourism, jobs and employment, business development, and real estate development. The cabinet will concern itself with increasing transparency and promoting accessibility for all Bostonians, especially women- and minority-owned businesses and local businesses, to share in and benefit from the economic boom in Boston."
  ],
  "overview":[
    "The Economic Development Cabinet includes the Office of Economic Development, Consumer Affairs & Licensing, and the Office of Tourism. Overall, the Cabinet will see a 11% increase in FY19 compared to its FY18 appropriation, largely based on critical investments to support a growing, diverse and inclusive workforce made in the Office of Economic Development",
    "The Office of Economic Development&rsquo;s (OED) FY19 budget will increase 18.7% over its FY18 appropriation. The growth in FY19 is primarily driven by investments in OED including additional funds to advance the disparity study that began in FY18, revisit the City&rsquo;s Economic Inclusion and Equity Agenda, and review the Main Streets Program. OED will also continue its ongoing efforts to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce in the City and cultivate the many businesses that contribute to Boston&rsquo;s robust economic climate and culture.",
    "Consumer Affairs and Licensing will increase by 4%, due to growth in personnel costs, along with an investment in interns that will help increase consumer engagement, to help mitigate the effects of potential scams on high-risk populations, such as the elderly and students."
