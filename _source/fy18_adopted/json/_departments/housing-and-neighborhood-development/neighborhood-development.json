This was the second round of NSP funding in the amount of $13.6M for the purpose of expanding the City&rsquo;s existing strategies of foreclosure prevention and reclamation efforts. Specifically, this funding allowed the City to support responsible redevelopment of foreclosed homes in those neighborhoods most burdened by Boston's bank-owned properties, namely Dorchester, East Boston, Roxbury, Hyde Park, and Mattapan. ARRA NSP was a three year grant totaling $13,610,343 that started on 2/11/2010 and ended 2/10/2013, however any program income received may continue to be expended."
