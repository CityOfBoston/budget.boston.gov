    "As a $2 billion investment in the City&rsquo;s assets, the Capital Plan supports economic growth in Boston by creating construction jobs and investing in infrastructure that unlocks economic activity. The Capital Plan also supports targeted investments to strengthen Boston&rsquo;s core and small businesses, as called for in Imagine Boston 2030. For example, roadway improvements in the Dudley Square Main Street district, with geometric changes, new traffic signal equipment and timing, bike lanes, and streetscape improvements, will improve access and safety. This project also begins implementation of the Go Boston 2030 goal to make public realm improvements in every Main Streets district in Boston by 2030. ",
    "The City will also collaborate with developers to improve roads and sidewalks along Harrison Avenue between East Berkeley Street and Herald Street. These infrastructure improvements are critical to economic development activity along the corridor with the recent development of InkBlock, which includes 471 housing units."
