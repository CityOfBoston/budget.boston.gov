    "Mayor Walsh announced a $1 billion investment to modernize Boston's public school infrastructure, and the BuildBPS plan will guide that process. Through a dedication of City capital funds and a strong working relationship with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA), the plan will more than double the capital spending on BPS facilities over the next decade. In total, Boston will invest $312 million in City Capital funds in BPS capital projects over the next five years, with an additional $418 million committed for the following five years. Mayor Walsh&rsquo;s FY18-22 Capital Plan implements early action BuildBPS initiatives and reserves funding for projects identified by the BuildBPS engagement process.",
    "The $13 million BuildBPS 21st Century Schools Fund will provide schools with 21st century tools, including new technology and comfortable, movable furniture. This initiative will promote learner-centric programs, benefit professional development, and provide greater flexibility in both current and future learning spaces. Relative to larger-scale building renovations and repairs, these upgrades can be done at lower cost and on an accelerated timeline. BPS will create a menu of 21st century packages that schools will be able to select from, depending on their needs. BPS will work with school leaders to complete these upgrades in the 2017-18 school year.",
    "Boston has also successfully ramped up its efforts to leverage MSBA Accelerated Repair Program (ARP) dollars to provide much needed improvements to its schools. This summer, Boston will invest $13.6 million to unlock a $16.3 million grant from the MSBA to provide seven BPS schools with new windows. In addition, the MSBA has approved a $6.4 million grant, with Boston providing $3.4 million in matching funds, to replace roofs and boilers at five BPS schools. The Mayor&rsquo;s Capital Plan sets aside an additional $24 million over five years to position Boston to further leverage MSBA ARP dollars in the future. ",
    "This Capital Plan allows Boston to invest in BPS projects already in the pipeline:",
    "Slated to be completed in winter of 2017/2018, the $73 million Dearborn STEM Academy will open for students in September 2018. The project, which leverages a projected $37 million match from the MSBA, is designed based upon a project-based learning curriculum, with an emphasis on STEM education. ",
    "Over the next two years, the Eliot School construction projects will be completed. The new $23 million North Bennet Street building will welcome 5th to 8th graders this fall into a 21st century learning environment, while this summer, the final phase of construction will begin at the Commercial Street building. ",
    "The Capital Plan provides for Boston&rsquo;s matching investment in the Josiah Quincy Upper School (JQUS) and Boston Arts Academy (BAA), which are collaborative projects with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA). "
