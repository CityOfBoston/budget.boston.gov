  "overview":[
    "The Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) will see a 1.3% increase over its FY17 appropriation. The FY18 budget invests in cybersecurity and technologies that will allow DoIT to work more efficiently. As part of the City&rsquo;s efforts to implement smart savings initiatives, DoIT will reduce contractor costs without reducing service.",
    "In FY18, DoIT will launch a new Digital Equity Pilot Grant Program to explore ways to address digital equity gaps in the City of Boston. Roughly 15% of Bostonians lack internet access at home. This limits access to educational, employment, and civic engagement opportunities. By providing seed funding for programs that help get more people online, the City hopes to identify promising strategies that can attract outside funding and help create a City where everyone has the tools and skills they need to succeed in the 21st century."
