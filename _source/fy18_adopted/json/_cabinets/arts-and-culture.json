  "mission":[
    "The mission of the Arts & Culture Cabinet is to foster the growth and well-being of the cultural community and promote participation in the arts. Recognizing the importance of creativity across all policy areas, the cabinet seeks to promote access to arts and culture to all the City&rsquo;s residents, and to make Boston a municipal arts leader."
  ],
  "overview":[
    "In FY18, funding for the Arts and Culture Cabinet will increase by 4.2%. The FY18 budget continues groundbreaking arts investments made in FY17 that are key to implementing Boston Creates, the City&rsquo;s cultural plan, through the planned use of $1.7 million in Boston Planning and Development Agency funding over two years. ",
    "Funding continues for Boston AIR (Artists in Residence), with the goal of injecting creative problem solving into municipal processes. The City will support individual artists through direct grants to Boston artists, awarded through a competitive process. Finally, Boston will continue to fund an Artist Resource Desk dedicated to helping artists and arts sector employees find the resources and assistance they need for their creative projects.",
    "The Boston Public Library (BPL) will see a 4.4% increase in FY18. The Library will be opening a Chinatown location as part of the City&rsquo;s continued effort to provide services, meeting places and learning centers to neighborhoods. The Library will also provide additional security and custodial services to improve the overall experience for patrons. Finally, the Library will achieve savings in FY18 through the elimination of long-term vacant positions. ",
    "In addition to the FY18 general fund budget, the BPL sees continued support from a variety of external funds. These sources include the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Associates of the Boston Public Library, Norman B. Leventhal Map Center, the City-Wide Friends of the Boston Public Library, and each branch friends group. These sources are crucial to the operations of the Library, as they support a variety of different initiatives. "
