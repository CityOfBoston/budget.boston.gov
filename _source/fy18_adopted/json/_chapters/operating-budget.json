            "The City&rsquo;s projected revenues provide the basis for planning FY18 appropriations to maintain a balanced budget. Selected FY18 budgeted City revenues compare with FY17 budgeted revenues as follows: the net property tax levy increases $113.7 million or 5.6%; excises increase $3.8 million or 2.0%; miscellaneous department revenues increase by $9.7 million or 17.4%; licenses and permits increase by $2.1 million or 3.4%, and state aid increases by $10.7 million or 2.5%.",
            "On the expenditure side of the budget, total appropriations increase by $96.7 million or 4.1% and fixed costs increase by $51.7 million or 8.3%. Selected FY18 budgeted appropriations compare with FY17 budgeted appropriations as follows: City Appropriations increase $32.0 million or 2.7%; the Boston Public Health Commission increases by $1.8 million or 2.3%; and the School Department increases $29.2 million or 2.8%. In addition, collective bargaining reserves are set aside for the School Department at $20 million and City Departments at $27 million; when collective bargaining agreements are negotiated, these reserves will be used to cover those increased costs. Within City Appropriations, actual City Departments are increasing by $25.6 million or 2.7% over FY17. These departmental increases are low relative to other years due to the expiration of nearly all collective bargaining agreements, 11 central appropriations, including a large appropriation for Health Insurance totaling $216.9 million which is increasing by $10.6 million or 5.2% and is also included within City Appropriations.",
            "FY18 budgeted fixed costs are increasing by $51.7 million and compare with FY17 budgeted fixed costs as follows: Pensions increase $21.9 million or 11%; Debt Service increases $9.6 million or 5.5%; Charter School Tuition state assessment increases $17.5 million or 11.2%; MBTA state assessment increases by $2 million or 2.4%; and other state assessments increases $44 thousand or 8.5%."

            "In Massachusetts, Proposition 2 1/2 constrains the amount of property tax revenue the City can raise each year from its existing tax base. This means that while total property value has grown 44% since FY14, property tax revenue has grown by only 17%. In each year since FY85, the City has increased its levy by the 2.5% allowable under the limits set forth in Proposition 2 1/2. ",
            "During these same years, the levy has also been positively impacted by taxable new value or &ldquo;new growth&rdquo; that is excluded from the levy limit. Due in part to efforts to attract business development to Boston and grow its housing stock, Boston experienced unprecedented new growth property tax revenue in FY17. New growth is expected to be approximately $53.0 million in FY18, which is very high compared to historical levels of new growth seen prior to FY17. "

Boston has seen its charter school costs rise dramatically since the enactment of the 2010 Achievement Gap Legislation (155% or $106.1 million between FY11 and FY18 Adopted Budget). Although the proposed charter school cap ballot initiative did not pass in 2016, the City anticipates that its assessment will continue to rise as tuition rates increase and the cap allows a moderate number of new seats each year. ",
            "Aside from the assessments for Charter School Tuition and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) state assessment growth is relatively small. In accordance with Proposition 2 1/2, these charges, except for Charter School Tuition, cannot increase by more than 2.5% annually on a statewide basis. "

The City&rsquo;s Position Review Committee continued to review all proposed job postings for vacant positions. All hiring was scrutinized and only critical positions were approved. Over 100 long-term vacant positions were eliminated in the FY17 budget.",
            "The School Department increased by 35.6 FTEs. The overall number of teachers was fairly stable with a reduction in regular education teachers mostly offset by more inclusion, bilingual, and specialist teachers. The department also saw an increase of 59.6 special education aides in classrooms. ",
            "City funded FTEs in the Public Safety Cabinet increased by 45. The Police Department&rsquo;s increase of 40 is due to the renewed cadet program which started in November 2016. The Fire Department had an increase of 5, due to slightly lower attrition. ",
            "The Mayor&rsquo;s Office Cabinet increased by 5.4 FTEs between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2017. The Mayor&rsquo;s Office increased with the transfer of a position supporting the Education Cabinet, additional support for the Resiliency Office, and Communications staff. The Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement declined by 1 FTE with a vacancy, while the Elections Department had an increase of 1 FTE.",
            "The Operations Cabinet had a net increase of 2 FTEs. Intergovernmental Relations decreased with the transfer of an education position to the Mayor&rsquo;s Office and a vacancy. In FY17, the newly restructured Public Facilities and Property Management Departments split into separate departments in order to better focus both functions. The net increase across the two departments is due to Public Facilities filling vacancies. ",
            "The Arts & Culture Cabinet declined by 3.1 FTEs with regular attrition in the Library Department. The Economic Development Cabinet increased by 0.9 FTEs with regular vacancies and hiring. In FY17, the Cabinet also had the merger of the Licensing Board into Consumer Affairs and Licensing.",
            "The Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet increased by 17 FTEs from January 2016 to January 2017. The Parks Department grew by 20 due to efforts to ensure parks are safe and clean and active hiring to fill vacancies, while Inspectional Services had a modest decrease of 3 FTEs due to attrition.",
            "The Health & Human Services Cabinet shows a net increase of 63.5 FTEs due primarily to targeted investments in EMTs, Homelessness Services, and Addiction Services at the Public Health Commission (total increase of 50.5 FTEs). The FY16 to FY17 changes at Boston Center for Youth and Families (+6), Boston VETS, and the Commission for Persons with Disabilities related to the filling of vacancies. Fair Housing & Equity increased by 2 FTEs with the appointment of an additional Fair Housing Commission member and a position coming off of a grant to the operating fund.",

These funds consist mainly of federal, state, and private funding earmarked for specific purposes. Education, housing, economic development, public health and public safety are some of the largest areas for which these funds are targeted.",
            "Twenty-seven departments and agencies expect to receive federal, state or other forms of external funding in FY18. Over 93% of the City&rsquo;s external funds are found in eight of those twenty-six departments. These eight departments are Boston Public Schools, Neighborhood Development, Public Health Commission, Emergency Management, Police, Library, Elderly Commission and the Parks and Recreation Department. Other departments that also have significant grant funding are the Office of Economic Development and the Fire Department. Descriptions and amounts of grants by department can be found in Volumes II and III.",
            "Federal grants have historically provided funding for key City priorities for education, community development, and services for seniors. Boston Public Schools, the Department of Neighborhood Development (DND), and the Elderly Commission have been the traditional recipients of recurring entitlement grants provided by the federal government.",
            "Although proposed federal budget cuts open questions about future levels of funding for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnership, this budget assumes that DND will continue to receive these recurring federal entitlement grants, which provide funding for a variety of neighborhood development activities. The City will advocate that these critical programs are maintained in the federal budget. Other sources of federal funding received by the City are used to address diverse needs and/or creative approaches for homeland security, community policing and housing support for the homeless.",

This continues the trend of the School Department accounting for the majority of position growth since 2014. In FY18, the School Department is projecting a net annual increase of 130.1 FTEs with higher projections for inclusion teachers and aides, specialist teachers related to the extended learning time (ELT) initiative, and professional support. The department is expanding ELT to 39 additional schools and continues to increase the number of inclusion classrooms.",
            "Historically, the number of Public Safety employees on the payroll as of January 1 of any year has fluctuated with the timing of retirements and new classes. In FY18 the Police Department is projected to remain fairly level assuming normal attrition and the hiring of a new class in the summer of 2017. However, 5 positions will transfer from Police to the Law Department as part of a multi-department consolidation of legal services. The projected increase in the Fire Department is due to 75 firefighters coming off of an expiring SAFER grant. The goal of the department is to have enough firefighters in the suppression force to cover the minimum manning level of 262 and to reduce overtime. A new fire class is planned for the late fall of 2017.",
            "The Operations Cabinet has an increase of 14 primarily due to the BuildBPS transfer of school construction responsibilities from Boston Public Schools to a new school unit at the Public Facilities Department (PFD). The increase is partially offset with the transfer of 3 legal services positions from PFD to the Law Department. The Property Management Department is adding new security positions, which will be funded through 3rd party billing. Property Management will also grow with 2 graffiti busters positions to support existing efforts to keep neighborhoods clean.",

The Environment Department is adding a position to support Renew Boston Trust and also a new preservation assistant to help reduce the wait times for Landmark Commission applications.

The Administration & Finance Cabinet projects an increase of 1 FTE with a new quality assurance loan management position in the Treasury Department. ",
            "The Health and Human Services Cabinet will increase by 22 FTEs primarily due to targeted investments in the Public Health Commission&rsquo;s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Recovery Services Bureau. EMS will add EMTs to a Community Assistance Team to respond to non-transport calls in Downtown Boston and the Recovery Road areas. The Public Health Commission will also add 4 FTEs to the PAATHS (Providing Access to Addictions Treatment, Hope and Support) Program to extend hours to evenings and weekends. The Commission&rsquo;s Mobile Sharps Team will double capacity to pick up improperly discarded hypodermic needles in response to an increase in requests submitted to 311. The Commission&rsquo;s Recovery Services Bureau will also add positions for a pilot low threshold engagement center. Additionally, the City will fund Homeless Services positions which were previously covered under federal grants. ",

A data analytics position will also transfer to the department from the Office of Administration & Finance. ",
            "The Streets Cabinet will increase by 8 FTEs. The Public Works Department is adding 6 additional full time hokeys (street cleaners) so that each of the 10 Public Works Districts will have regular service from the neighborhood-focused program. The Office of Streets plans to hire a Small Cell/DAS Approval Process Manager to better manage the Street Lighting division and the small cell program.
