Accomplishment of our mission is ensured through the use of planning, coordinated engineering, education and enforcement. The Transportation Department strives to improve circulation in and around the City, enhance public transportation services, gain efficiencies in the management of parking resources, adjudicate and collect fines, collaborate with relevant agencies and encourage the use of alternate transportation modes."

In order to ensure an efficient yet safe flow of traffic and to balance competing demands for parking resources, the Department enforces 42 parking regulations, maintains and collects from the City's 7,100 parking meters, and annually replaces or repairs several thousand of the City's 300,000 street and traffic signs. The Department also continually responds to the changing transportation needs of the City and its neighborhoods by re-evaluating traffic patterns, increasing parking enforcement in response to neighborhood requests, incorporating the City's interests into state and federal roadway developments, and working to promote alternative modes of transportation for commuters."
