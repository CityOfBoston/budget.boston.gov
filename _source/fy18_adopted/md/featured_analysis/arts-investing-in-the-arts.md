      The Mayor’s Office of <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/arts-and-culture">Arts 
      and Culture</a> released the City’s first cultural plan, 
      <a href="http://www.bostoncreates.org/">Boston Creates</a>, in 2016, calling for increased 
      support to Boston’s arts and culture ecosystem.
    description: >
      The Percent for Art Program, included for the first time in the FY18-22 Capital 
      Plan, is a critical policy outcome of this planning process. The Percent for Art 
      Program demonstrates the City’s leadership and commitment to sustainable funding 
      for the arts by setting aside one percent of the City’s annual capital borrowing 
      for the commissioning of public art. <blockquote>Thanks to this commitment, the City will 
      invest $1.7 million in public art projects in FY18.</blockquote>

      <h5>Artists in Residence program</h5>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.publicartboston.com/content/boston-air">Boston Artists 
      in Residence (AIR) program</a> seeks to embed working artists 
      in City departments and agencies to promote creative thought in municipal problem-solving 
      and project implementation. By deeply integrating artists into City processes, 
      both City staff and the public learn firsthand the multifaceted ways in which the 
      arts engage complex problems and create new opportunities.</p>
      <p>In FY17, Boston AIR artists were placed in ten neighborhood-based community 
      centers including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/south-boston">South Boston</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/roslindale">Roslindale</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/mattapan">Mattapan</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/hyde-park">Hyde Park</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/jamaica-plain">Jamaica Plain</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/south-end">South End</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/dorchester">Dorchester</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/mission-hill">Mission Hill</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/chinatown-leather-district">Chinatown</a>; and</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/neighborhood/roxbury">Roxbury</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Adding clarity to City services</h5>
      <p>In response to artists who felt disconnected from City Hall and sought clarity 
      on how to access City resources, the Artist Resource Manager provides staff support for:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>permitting, zoning, and other regulatory requirements for arts and culture uses;</li>
      <li>communicating professional opportunities; and</li>
      <li>navigating other municipal services.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>New programs</h5>
      <p><a href="https://www.boston.gov/arts-and-culture/opportunity-fund">The Opportunity Fund</a> is 
      a pilot grant program that offers grants of up to $1,000 
      to support individual artists in activities that help them share their work with 
      the public, teach others, continue their professional development, and hone their 
      skills. To date in FY17, over 275 artists have applied for the fund, and 62 have 
      been awarded.</p>
      <p>This year, the City will launch an artist fellowship program, in response to 
      feedback in the Boston Creates process that we identify new funding streams for 
      Boston artists. This fellowship will be aimed at supporting and elevating Boston 
      creatives.</p>
