      The creation of a Performance Meter comprised of 14 key performance indicators 
      (KPIs) associated with school improvement was an initiative that developed as 
      part of Superintendent Chang’s 100 Day Plan.
    description: >
      The Performance Meter is a critical step in establishing a performance management 
      culture within the District and will allow BPS to identify the most effective supports 
      for schools. <blockquote>The Performance Meter tracks KPIs concentrated on the achievement gap, 
      early literacy, proficiency of certain age groups at specific subjects, and 
      college and career readiness.</blockquote> The use of authentic evidence and data 
      will allow BPS to continue to close the opportunity and achievement gap.

      a 1.7% increase over 2015 rate. The BPS high school graduation rate has increased each 
      year since the 2006-2007 school year when the graduation rate was 57.9%. The 2016 graduation 
      rate is the highest ever recorded by BPS.</p>

      <div class="intro-text supporting-text">BPS's annual dropout rate for students in 
      grades 9-12 increased slightly from 
      4.4% to 4.5% in the 2015-16 school year. Previously, BPS had two consecutive years 
      that it achieved its lowest dropout rate on record. In 2014, Boston’s dropout rate, 
      a significant indicator of a school’s effectiveness, dropped below 4% for the 
      first time in history.</div> <blockquote>According to state guidelines, students in 
      grades 6-12 are counted as dropouts if they leave school during the year for any 
      reason other than transfer, graduation, death or expulsion with an option to 
      return.</blockquote>
