    "The Commissioner's Office is responsible for overseeing daily departmental operations, including the development and implementation of an Automated Permitting and Inspection System (APIS).   This system will provide for full online permitting and centralize the intake and scheduling of service requests and response to complaints.  The permitting software solution will also be the framework for a permit management system involving all city agencies participating in the building permitting.  This system will also enable ISD to share information among divisions by means of a centralized data management system.\n\nThe Commissioner's Office coordinates all policy and planning functions, as well as focusing the Department's efforts to disseminate information in an understandable and timely manner.  \n\nThe Inspectional Services Department (ISD) is comprised of six regulatory divisions, namely, Building and Structures, Housing, Health, Environmental Services, Weights & Measures and Animal Care and Control, with the aim to protect and improve the quality of life for all City of Boston residents by effectively administering and enforcing regulations mandated by City and State governments."
