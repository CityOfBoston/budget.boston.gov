    "The Firefighter Safety, Health and Wellness program works to protect and promote the well-being of Firefighters as they perform physically challenging responsibilities.  The program includes creating awareness through fitness and medical evaluations, encouraging physical fitness and healthy eating and living, improving personal protective equipment, and providing safe driver training.  Firefighters who are more physically fit, in addition to benefiting from general wellness benefits, encounter fewer workplace injuries from physically challenging repetitive situations."
