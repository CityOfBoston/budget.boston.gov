The program breaks down into three primary components: 1. the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) works to meet the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations; 2. the Safer (Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response) Grant program provides funding directly to the fire department (Fire Prevention) in order to help increase the number of trained, &ldquo;front-line&rdquo; firefighters available in the City; 3. the Fire Prevention and Safety Grants (FPandS) grants support projects that enhance the safety of the public and firefighters from fire and related hazards. The primary goal is to target high-risk populations, firefighter safety and mitigate high incidences of death and injury. Since FY2007, the department has been awarded six grants from these programs for the purchase of firefighting and personal protective equipment such as computer terminals, computer tablets, protective rescue boots, mobile portable radios and other communications equipment. In addition, for the first time in FY2009, the program funded a rear mounted aerial ladder truck for deployment in the department&rsquo;s fleet."
