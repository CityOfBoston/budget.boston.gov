NHPRC has granted the City of Boston an award of up to $91,604 for the Project to Consolidate and Preserve the Archival Records of the City of Boston. The project will conduct a survey of departments and compile an inventory of the City&rsquo;s permanent records, both hard copy and electronic; secure hard-copy archives at the newly-renovated City Archives Center; and plan for the preservation of electronic archives. The accomplishment of this goal will advance the City Archives mission to achieve the comprehensive and systematic preservation of the City&rsquo;s archival records, and to ensure ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of municipal officials and Boston's historical municipal experience."
