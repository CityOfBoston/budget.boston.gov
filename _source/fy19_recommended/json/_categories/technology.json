    "Consistent with Imagine Boston 2030 and Go Boston 2030, Boston will invest in intelligent traffic signals to improve safety and reduce congestion. Through funding in the Capital Plan, the City will begin a transformation to the next generation of traffic signal technology, with an initial focus on some of the City&rsquo;s busiest corridors and bus routes. This innovation will minimize delay and maximize coordination across signals. The Capital Plan also funds a multi-year program to create improved and - in many cases - signalized intersections in some of the more challenging locations in the City. This includes the Father Hart Bridge area in Hyde Park, where the City aims to install new traffic signals at each end of the bridge as well as at the interconnected signals in Wolcott Square.",
    "The City will continue investing in the Boston Fiber Network (BoNet) to improve Boston&rsquo;s fiber backbone and infrastructure. The goal is to provide broadband services to 73 additional Boston Public Schools, 24 family public housing developments and more than 100 City buildings, while also strengthening public safety communications. Expanding Boston&rsquo;s Fiber Optic Network to these schools will deliver gigabit (1 Gbps) bandwidth capacity for online testing, learning, administrative and video services, and in-campus Wi-Fi. Additionally, this investment will help the City to expand and improve public safety services across the City and present opportunities to deploy Wicked Free Wi-Fi to a broader geography.",
    "To continue to make City services responsive to real time data, the Capital Plan also allows for the investment in Boston311 to deliver a more personalized experience for many services and better understand how customers interact with the City across departments. Boston will continue to bring new services online, update existing services to improve user experience, and adapt to evolving technology trends and customer expectations."
