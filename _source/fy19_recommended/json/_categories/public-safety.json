    "As part of the Imagine Boston 2030 initiative to reduce cancer risks for firefighters, the Capital Plan will include health and safety improvements to firehouse projects. In FY16 and FY17 the Fire Department, in conjunction with the Public Facilities Department, studied best practices for firehouse design and will now utilize an enhanced set of building programs for new and renovated firehouses. Key changes include separating out different areas of the firehouse to keep fire contaminants away from living areas, and improved personal and gear cleaning facilities. The new Engines 42 and 17 will be among of the first firehouses in the nation to reflect these enhancements. The City is also renovating neighborhood police stations. Design is underway on the new East Boston Police Station, a $25.5 million project that will replace the existing A-7 station, which has passed its useful life, and will take advantage of underutilized land in East Boston.",
    "In 2016, the City launched an accelerated fire apparatus replacement plan, which will replace nearly 50 percent of the fleet by the end of 2019. In FY17, the department purchased 16 new fire trucks to replace a series of apparatus with known mechanical issues and improve public safety by increasing the number of apparatus in the reserve fleet. The plan will continue with the purchase of fire engine trucks, ladders and a tower ladder in FY18.",
    "The Police Department is upgrading and replacing its radio system to serve our Police Officers, as it had outlived its useful life. The project will include $56 million in operating and capital investments over four years. Looking toward future radio needs for other public safety and civilian departments, DoIT will conduct a feasibility study to determine the most cost effective and efficient way to expand and sustain the infrastructure that supports the radio systems of multiple City departments."
