    "To encourage a healthy environment, including safe streets and communities, Boston is renovating several neighborhood community centers to better serve residents&rsquo; needs. In FY18, Mayor Walsh is launching a major renovation to the BCYF Curley Community Center, an asset of the South Boston community. The heavily used building, which spans nearly a quarter mile on the South Boston beachfront, has an outdated layout for today&rsquo;s usage, and is in need of a major renovation. Currently under construction, the BCYF Paris Street Community Center is undergoing a major renovation to better meet the East Boston community&rsquo;s needs by providing additional programming space, a Teen Center, a new gym floor, a rock climbing wall, and a new fitness area. Construction will begin in FY18 on renovations to the BCYF Vine Street Community Center in Roxbury and the BCYF Gallivan Community Center in Mattapan."
