    "The Operations Cabinet oversees all operational activities that intersect with the management of central facilities. The cabinet includes departments that set policies for intergovernmental relations and central municipal properties."
  ],
  "overview":[
    "The budget for the Operations Cabinet is declining by 4.6%, largely due to a change in the accounting for security personnel paid for with external resources and the tightening of utilities budgets.",
    "The Public Facilities department budget will be increasing by 1.8%. As part of the BuildBPS ten-year Educational and Facilities Master Plan for the Boston Public Schools, school construction responsibilities will be moved into a new schools unit in the City of Boston&rsquo;s Public Facilities department. This reform will consolidate resources and expertise that are currently fragmented and allow Boston to modernize Boston's public school infrastructure. Because the move will occur partly through the fiscal year, the Boston Public School&rsquo;s budget includes the funding for the unit, which it will provide to the Public Facilities Department through a chargeback.",
    "Due to a change in the accounting for security personnel charged to outside entities, the Property Management Department&rsquo;s budget will decrease by 6.8%. In addition, utilities budgets throughout City departments, including Property Management, are tightened in FY18. The Property Management Department will also be responsible for the care and maintenance of the new trees on City Hall Plaza, as a result of an agreement with the MBTA."
