  "overview":[
    "The overall FY19 budget for the Mayor&rsquo;s Office Cabinet will increase 10.6% over the FY18 appropriation. The cabinet contains the Mayor&rsquo;s Office, the Election Department, the Law Department, and the Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement. The majority of this growth is driven by the City&rsquo;s consolidation of legal services into the law department, and the purchase of new voting equipment.",
    "The Mayor&rsquo;s Office&rsquo;s budget will increase 3.1% in FY19 due to investments in its Communications and Education Advisor units. ",
    "The Election Department budget will increase by 10% in FY19. This increase includes funding related to early voting requirements, which are applicable in FY19 but were not applicable in FY18. The increase also reflects a lease purchase investment in new voting machines for the City's 262 voting precincts.",
    "The Law Department's budget is increasing by 15.7% primarily due to the transfer of legal staff from various City departments to the Law Department budget as part of the continuation of consolidation of legal services. Legal staff will be transferring to the Law Department from the Treasury, Inspection Services, and Human Resources Departments."
