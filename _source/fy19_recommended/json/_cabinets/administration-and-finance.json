The cabinet will see a 4% increase in FY18, with the nine city departments within the cabinet decreasing 0.5%. Budget increases for two central appropriations in the cabinet, including Health Insurance and Medicare, account for 100% of increase in the cabinet&rsquo;s budget.",
    "The AandF cabinet has also budgeted resources in FY18 to continue the successful program of independent operational audits, and to pursue revenue maximization.",
    "In FY18, the Office of Budget Management will initiate revenue audits to verify the accuracy of information reported with certain fees. The City anticipates recovering $2 million in new revenue through these audits."
