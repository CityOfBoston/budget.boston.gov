      The team has worked with nearly every department to identify opportunities for

      <h5>Analytics work in FY18</h5>
      <p>In FY18, the Analytics team will provide more extensive training, licensing, 
      and data access for department users so that they can more readily work with 
      their own data and combine it with other resources. As departments become more 
      self-sufficient for their own day-to-day analytics needs, the Citywide Analytics 
      Team will focus a growing proportion of its work on more specialized data 
      science and GIS projects in areas such as predictive modeling, automated 
      text analysis, and interactive applications.</p>

      <h5>Future work</h5>
      <p>In the future, these efforts will give the City new resources to more efficiently:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>process 311 requests and resident feedback;</li>
      <li>protect the health and safety of firefighters and police officers;</li>
      <li>help students at risk of failing or dropping out of school; and</li>
      <li>promote safe, affordable, and accessible housing for all residents.</li>
      </ul>
