      The City of Boston is investing in its students to invest in its future. Education comprises 40% of the FY18 budget with a projected $1.081 billion to support Boston Public Schools and $174.3 million to support approximately 10,600 Boston students in charter schools.

      <p>Education also comprises 40% of the growth in the budget, with an increase of $57.8 million (4.8%) over FY17. This increase is in spite of a projected increase of just $1 million in Chapter 70 Education Aid and a charter reimbursement that is projected to be underfunded by $25 million by the state.</p>
      <p>Over the last 4 years, Boston has increased its annual spending on education by $207 milliion despite a reduction in education funding from the state.</p>

        , this marks the largest Boston Public Schools budget in history. With this 
        investment, Mayor Walsh has increased funding for the Boston Public Schools’ 
        annual budget by $143 million, and BPS staff levels will have increased by 
        approximately 250 since taking office. <blockquote>Funding directed to schools 
        will increase by almost 4%, even before the largest driver of BPS costs, employee 
        collective bargaining increases, are negotiated, a $25 million increase over 
        FY17.</blockquote>

        <h5>Closing the opportunity and achievement gap</h5>
        <p>In FY18, Boston Public Schools is proposing to make important research-backed 
        investments to close the opportunity and achievement gap.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Boston is investing $14 million to give 15,000 students, from kindergarten 
        through 8th-grade, 120 additional hours of learning time — or the equivalent of 20 
        more school days a year.</li>
        <li>In addition, by strengthening BPS’s commitment to Excellence For All, more 
        students in the fourth and fifth grade will receive the same rigorous instruction 
        and enriched learning opportunities as those in Advanced Work Class (AWC).</li>
        <li>Boston is also making a strategic $1.2 million investment to support 3,000 
        BPS students identified by the district as experiencing homelessness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>BPS will also be providing lower performing schools with a wide-range of 
        differentiated supports, which total over $16 million. This includes a new $1.25 
        million reserve focused on supporting low level 3, 4 and 5 schools with declining 
        enrollment.

      <h5>Long-Term Financial Planning project</h5>
      <p>Efforts to tighten budget management and identify efficiencies, along with Mayor 
      Walsh’s commitment to education funding, make possible $20M of BPS investments. 
      While the School Committee approved a balanced budget for FY18, the District still 
      has underlying challenges that require structural changes to allow Boston to continue 
      to effectively invest in its students in future years.</p>
