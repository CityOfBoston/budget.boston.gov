      <p>The majority of departments had employees who reached agreement on collective bargaining contracts, so department growth reflects those wage and cost of living increases, while outstanding contracts are reserved centrally. 
      <blockquote>Average department growth is projected to be 3.5% in FY19. </blockquote>
      Funding for unsettled City and BPS collective bargaining contracts are centralized in a $41 million collective bargaining reserve.</p>
      <p>To make targeted investments, the City is pursuing 
      smart savings initiatives in the FY19 Budget:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Managing overtime continues to be a priority. Although overtime budgets will increase due to collective bargaining wage increases, the budgeted hours have been established at achievable levels and are intended to produce an estimated $6.9 million in savings.</li>
      <li>Boston will realize $11.6 million in avoided health care costs in FY19, $1.5 million of which are related to FY19 specific changes.</li>
      <li>City departments and the Public Health Commission include a combined $10 million in maintenance budget savings in FY19.</li>
      <li>Continuing the practice proactive review, the City eliminated long-term vacant positions from the budget in FY19 for $400,000 in savings.</li> 
      <li>Having realized savings by bringing street sweeping in West Roxbury in-house in FY18, Hyde Park street sweeping will be done in-house in FY19 saving $145,000.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through these efforts, the FY19 budget avoids significant costs and reinvests savings into valuable programs and investments.</p>
