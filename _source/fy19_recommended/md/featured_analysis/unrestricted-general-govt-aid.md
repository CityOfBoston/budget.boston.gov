      For the FY10 budget and going forward, the Governor and the Legislature 
      combined general government aid from Additional Assistance and Lottery 
      into one account - UGGA.
    description: >
      Revenue derived from the State’s lottery now accounts for nearly all funds 
      disbursed through UGGA. The current distribution of UGGA is a weighted 
      average of both Lottery and Additional Assistance distributions of the past. 
      <blockquote>For Boston, the combined accounts totaled $168.6 million in FY15 
      and $174.7 million in FY16. In FY17, the City will receive $182.2 million 
      and has budgeted for an increase to $189.3 million for FY18, which is 
      included in the Governor’s FY18 Budget.</blockquote>
