      Finally, $32 million (22%) of the budget growth is committed to addressing the 
      City’s long-term obligations and paying off debt taken on for school buildings, 
      roads and bridges, police and fire stations, parks, and other public assets. 
    description: >
      Due to generations of underfunding the City’s pension obligations, the City’s 
      pension schedule requires a 9.5% increase this year. This budget again dedicates 
      $40 million toward reducing the City’s long term other post-employment benefits 
      (OPEB) liability. <blockquote>Actively addressing the City’s long-term liabilities 
      is not only fiscally responsible, it is critical to maintaining Boston’s AAA bond 
      rating, which unlocks additional capacity to fund more capital projects.</blockquote>

      <h5>Debt service costs</h5>
      <p>The City borrows every year to support investments in its roads, 
      bridges, school buildings, parks and police and fire stations. Based on its AAA 
      bond rating, the City has continued to benefit from favorable interest rates and its 
      position as an attractive investment. This high bond rating will be integral to 
      unlocking a $1 billion investment in Boston schools over the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>Even with the recent favorable borrowings, debt service costs are projected
      to increase by $10.6 million (6.1%) in FY18.</p>
