      In 1993, the Commonwealth began an effort to increase and equalize 
      funding for local education. The Chapter 70 formula derived from that 
      effort establishes a foundation budget, or a minimum level of education 
      spending in each school district, which the state and district then 
      share the cost of funding.
    description: >
      The Chapter 70 Education Aid formula does not work for Boston. Despite the 
      Commonwealth adding over $994 million to Chapter 70 Aid since FY08, in FY18 
      Boston’s Chapter 70 Aid is only $1.6 million higher than it was in FY08. 
      The City received Chapter 70 education aid totaling $211.0 million in FY15 
      and $212.6 million in FY16. The City expects to receive $216.1 million from 
      the state in FY17 and $217.4 million in FY18, a 0.6% increase from FY17.

        <h5>Charter school costs rising</h5>
        <p>Charter schools are publicly-funded schools administered independently 
        from local school districts and teachers’ union rules and regulations. Their 
        charters are granted by the State Board of Education. <blockquote>Boston’s 
        Charter School Tuition Assessment is projected to increase by $17.5 million, 
        or 11.2%, over the FY17 budget, as 10,599 students are projected to attend a 
        Commonwealth Charter School in FY18.</blockquote></p>

        <p>Boston has seen its charter school costs rise dramatically since the enactment 
        of the 2010 Achievement Gap Legislation (155% or $106 million between 2011 and 
        2018). The Charter School Tuition Reimbursement is budgeted at $23.6 million 
        in FY18, $2.9 million higher than FY17, but a projected $25 million lower than 
        the Commonwealth’s obligation under the 2010 Achievement Gap Legislation.</p>

        <h5>State charter school funding lags</h5>
        <p>In the 2010 law, when tuition payments increase for a given school district 
        over the prior year, the state reimburses that district for 100% of the increased 
        cost in the first year (when the formula is fully-funded). The state then reimburses 
        25% of this first year increase amount for each of the subsequent five years. Cities 
        and town are also reimbursed for the portion of the charter school assessment 
        related to facilities.</p>
        <p>Because the Commonwealth has underfunded the appropriation, the Commonwealth has 
        only funded a portion of the first year costs, and cities and towns have not been 
        reimbursed for the subsequent five years. Unfortunately the Commonwealth has not 
        fulfilled its obligation under the 2010 law to fund Charter School Tuition Reimbursement, 
        totaling a projected $73 million in lost revenue for Boston in FY15 and FY18.</p>
        <h5>Net cost to the City growing</h5>
        <p>The net cost to the City for charter schools (reimbursement from the Commonwealth 
        less tuition assessment) has grown dramatically as Boston’s Charter School Tuition 
        Assessment has increased and the Commonwealth stopped fully funding the charter school 
        reimbursement which is meant to ease transition costs. <blockquote>In FY15 the cost was 
        $104.6 million and in FY16, $120.3 million. In FY17 the City has budgeted a $136.2 million 
        net impact, and in FY17, $150.7 million.</blockquote></p>
