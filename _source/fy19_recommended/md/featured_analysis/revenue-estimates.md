      The City’s projected revenues provide the basis for planning FY18 
      appropriations to maintain a balanced budget.

      Local sources continue to drive revenue growth in FY18, as property 
      tax and local receipts make up 93% of revenue growth over FY17.

      <h5>Declining State revenue</h5>
      <p>While the City is expected to experience continued robust property 
      tax growth in FY18, overall revenue growth is expected to be hampered by 
      sluggish state revenue growth. <blockquote>State revenue, the City’s second 
      largest revenue source, never recovered following the last recession, and 
      in FY18, Boston’s state revenue is budgeted to grow at 2.5% over FY17.</blockquote></p>
      <p>Net State Aid (state aid net of assessments) is budgeted to decline 
      as continued increases in state assessments for charter school tuition 
      surpass stagnant budgeted state revenue.</p>

        <h5>Growing our revenue base</h5>
        <p>The continued net decline in state aid highlights the risk of relying 
        on any one source of revenue. The City protects and grows its revenue base 
        through the expansion of current revenue sources and the pursuit of diversified 
        revenue sources that fit well with its economic strengths.</p>
        <p>Selected FY18 budgeted City revenues compare with FY17 budgeted revenues as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>the net property tax levy increases by $110.7 million or 5.4%;</li>
        <li>excises increase by $720 thousand or 0.4%;</li>
        <li>miscellaneous department revenues increase by $9.7 million or 17.4%;</li>
        <li>licenses and permits increase by $3.5 million or 5.6%, and</li>
        <li>state aid increases by $10.7 million or 2.5%.</li>
        </ul>
