      first municipal office in the U.S. solely dedicated to addressing substance use 
      and addiction. In the past year, ORS initiated a partnership with Boston Fire,

        <p>In FY18, the City will build on the success of the PAATHS program and enable it 
        to expand services to evenings and weekends. This new investment, which includes 
        funding for three Public Health Advocates, a Clinician, and a Program Director, 
        allows the program to remain open until 7:00 pm on weekdays and from 
        9:00 am to 4:00 pm on weekends.</p>
