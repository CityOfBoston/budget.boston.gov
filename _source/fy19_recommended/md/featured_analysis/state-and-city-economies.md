      <h5>Boston unemployment rate</h5>
      <p>The unemployment rate had been decreasing for both the State and City. The 
      rate in Massachusetts has since fallen to 3.1% as of December 2016, which is still 
      slightly higher than the 2.6% seen in the year 2000; however, this is due to 
      growth in the labor force.</p>
      <p>The state and local economies have regained all jobs lost during the recent 
      recessions and have reached peaks. The City of Boston’s unemployment rate has 
      steadily fallen to 2.7% as of December 2016.</p>

      <h5>Wage growth</h5>
      <p>Massachusetts wage and salary income in the fourth quarter of 2016 rose 4.3% 
      over the same quarter 2016, continuing a trend of positive year-over-year quarterly 
      growth rates since first quarter 2010. Earnings growth by industry grouping over the 
      period of the last quarter in 2015 to 2016 was strongest in “Utilities” and “Durable 
      Good and Manufacturing”, while “Forestry, fishing, and related activities” and “State 
      and Local” showed the weakest growth during the same period. 
      <blockquote>Massachusetts’ seasonally adjusted total personal income rose 4.1% from 
      2015 to 2016, 12th out of the 50 states and DC in terms of growth and just above 
      the national average of 3.5%.</blockquote></p>
