      In 2015, Mayor Walsh appointed Boston’s first Chief Resilience Officer 
      to lead the City’s efforts to develop an integrated Resilience Strategy 
      that will help Boston thrive in both good and challenging times. 
    description: >
      While this strategy will address a wide range of issues, achieving 
      racial equity has emerged at the very core of Boston’s efforts to build 
      resilience. Boston is bringing conversations about racism, healing and 
      policy work into its neighborhoods.

      <h5>Developing the Resilience Strategy</h5>
      <p>The FY18 budget replaces Rockefeller Foundation grant funding ending 
      in FY18 and will allow the Mayor’s Office of Resilience and Racial Equity 
      to continue efforts in developing and implementing an integrated Resilience 
      Strategy that will help Boston:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>diversify its workforce</li>
        <li>create shared prosperity by exploring ways to impact economic mobility 
        close achievement gaps, and</li>
        <li>work to address systemic and generational challenges to racial equity.</li>
       </ul>

      <h5>Recruitment campaign</h5>
      <p>Additional resources for the Mayor’s Diversity Office will fund a proactive 
      recruitment campaign that includes a series of job fairs and an enhanced matching tool 
      for potential applicants and postings. The budget for the Diversity Office will 
      also support an internal employee development program to help employees achieve an 
      undergraduate degree tuition free, by partnering with local universities.</p>

      <h5>Digital Equity Pilot Grant Program</h5>
      <p>The new Digital Equity Pilot Grant Program will explore ways to address digital 
      equity gaps in the City of Boston. Roughly 15% of Bostonians lack internet access at 
      home. This limits access to educational, employment, and civic engagement opportunities.
      <blockquote>By providing seed funding for programs that help get more people online, the City 
      hopes to identify promising strategies that can attract outside funding and help create 
      a City where everyone has the tools and skills they need to succeed in the 
      21st century.</blockquote></p>
