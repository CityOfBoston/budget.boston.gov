      Research confirms that prekindergarten has a positive impact on student 
      achievement in the Boston Public Schools.  BPS currently serves approximately 
      2,500 children in pre-kindergarten classrooms, and demand increases every year.
    description: >
      Those students are part of the 90% of Boston’s 5,350 four-year-olds who are 
      enrolled in a pre-kindergarten program, in either a school or community-based 
      setting.  BPS early education programs have been recognized as among the 
      most effective in the nation at closing achievement gaps. They are content-rich 
      in science, literacy, arts and math. <blockquote>Data shows BPS prekindergarten 
      attendees outperform their peers in third and fifth grade MCAS, both in ELA 
      and in Math.</blockquote>

        <h5>Expanding seats</h5>
        <p>In FY18, Mayor Walsh will continue his successful campaign to expand BPS pre-kindergarten (K1) seats and make an investment to establish a universal pre-k infrastructure. With more than 100 additional K1 students to be served in FY18, Mayor Walsh will have added 422 K1 seats to BPS since he took office at a total investment of over $4.3 million. <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/new-comprehensive-education-finance-reform-legislation">Mayor Walsh has also filed early education finance legislation</a> to close the “quality gap” in pre-kindergarten seats in Boston by investing in programs at BPS and in community based organizations.</p>

        <h5>Addressing the gap</h5>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/boston_upk_report_april_2016.pdf">Universal Pre-Kindergarten (UPK) taskforce</a> estimates a 1,350 seat gap in Boston between the number of quality seats — roughly 4,000 — and the current number of 4-year olds (5,350). To dedicate $16.5 million to early education, this legislation would redirectthe surplus amounts generated by two Convention Center Fund revenues that are produced exclusively in Boston.</p>

        <h5>Strengthening programs</h5>
        <p>BPS will continue to strengthen and expand programs, particularly full-day K1 classrooms for four-year-olds. More than half of BPS early childhood classrooms haveearned accreditation from the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), affirming that these programs offer high-quality, state-of-the-art education to help to get children off to successful starts. </p>
