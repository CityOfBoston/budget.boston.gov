  - title: Financing the FY18-FY22 capital plan
    short_desc: >
      The capital plan is financed with general obligation bonds issued by the City, 
      other City funds, state grants, federal grants, and private grants.
    description: >
      General obligation bonds represent 60.2% of all project funding. This year’s 
      plan assumes $950 million in new general obligation borrowings over the next 
      five years, a 22.5% increase to last year’s plan. This borrowing level remains 
      sustainable within the City’s debt affordability policy.

    body: > 
      State and federal financing represent 32.8% of all project funding. Programs, such 
      as the School Building Assistance program, Chapter 90 and the Transportation 
      Improvement Program, provide key resources for Boston’s capital plan. Funds for 
      capital financing are currently estimated at $379.0 million from state programs 
      and $301.4 million from federal programs.

  - title: School Building Assistance Program
    body: >
      The School Building Assistance (SBA) program, administered by the Massachusetts 
      School Building Authority (MSBA), is an important revenue source for school renovation 
      and construction. <blockquote>Annually, the MSBA accepts new project requests from 
      cities, towns, and school districts, and if a project is ultimately approved, the MSBA \
      will pay 40% to 80% of eligible project costs.</blockquote>

  - col: >
      <h5>Renovations and construction</h5>
      <p>The MSBA operates two major programs – the Core Program and the Accelerated 
      Repair Program (ARP). Major renovation and new construction projects are funded 
      through the Core Program. The ARP funds roof, boiler, and window replacement projects 
      in school buildings that are otherwise sound. <blockquote>The City currently has three 
      projects in the Core Program — the Dearborn STEM Academy, the Boston Arts Academy, 
      and the Josiah Quincy Upper Pilot School.</blockquote></p>
      <p>Construction of the new Dearborn STEM Academy is underway and will open for students 
      in September 2018. The MSBA has approved a maximum project grant totaling $37.4 million 
      which covers 50.8% of the current project budget.</p>
      <p>Feasibility studies are underway for the Boston Arts Academy and the Josiah Quincy 
      Upper School. The City expects to select a preferred option for each of these projects 
      in the first half of fiscal 2018.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Other projects</h5>
      <p>The City has two projects underway through the Accelerated Repair Program. The City 
      entered into a Project Funding Agreement last year for a window and door replacement 
      project at seven schools. The MSBA’s maximum grant totals nearly $16.4 million. The total 
      project cost is over $29 million. Construction will begin on the window project in June 
      and is expected to be completed before the end of the calendar year.</p>
      <p>The City expects to complete a roof and boiler project at five schools later this year. 
      The MSBA’s grant covers up to $6.4 million of this $9.8 million project.</p>
      <p>For the period FY18-22, total payments from the MSBA for legacy projects are estimated 
      at $14.3 million. The state payments offset debt service costs for school building assistance 
      projects approved by the Department of Education prior to the creation of the MSBA in 2004.</p>

  - title: Chapter 90 Funds
    body: >
      Administered by the Massachusetts Highway Department, Chapter 90 funds are allocated by 
      formula through state bond authorizations and through the state budget to all cities and 
      towns in the Commonwealth. The City uses Chapter 90 funds to support its roadway resurfacing 
      and reconstruction programs as well as its sidewalk reconstruction programs. <blockquote>The 
      City anticpates an allocation of approximately $14.4 million in FY18.</blockquote>

  - title: Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
    body: >
      The Transportation Improvement Program is a statewide road and bridge construction 
      advertisement program developed under the management of the Massachusetts Department of 
      Transportation (MassDOT). It includes both local and state owned roads and bridges. 
      The TIP’s funding sources include state-issued general obligation bonds and federal 
      funds made available through the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation
      Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).

- text_col_2:
  - col: >
      <h5>City sources of Other Funds</h5>
      <p>Other Funds is a revenue category that includes both City and non-City sources.</p>
      <p>City sources of Other Funds include the Street Opening Account which funds the permanent 
      repair of utility cuts and pavement restoration. Transfers from the Surplus Property Fund, 
      Parking Meter Fund, and the General Fund are also categorized as Other Funds.</p>
      <p>In fiscal 2018, the City proposes transferring $45.4 million from the Parking Meter 
      Fund to the Capital Grants Fund and appropriating it for sixteen one-time capital projects, 
      including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the reconstruction of pathways around Jamaica Pond;
          <li>a Crosswalk and Lane Marking Revitalization initiative; and</li>
          <li>the reconstruction of Beach Street.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Using the Parking Meter Fund revenue in this way allows the City to make increased 
      investments in infrastructure at the same time that increased investment in the BuildBPS 
      program is supported by additional debt issuance.</p>
  - col: >      
      <h5>Constraints of debt</h5>
      <p>The constraints of our debt affordability policies limit the City’s capacity to 
      address both needs through debt issuance alone. This is an opportunity to use available 
      Parking Meter Fund balances for investments in one-time projects aligned with Go Boston 
      2030, the City’s transportation master plan. Through this appropriation, the City will 
      address important transportation capital needs.</p>
      <h5>Non-City sources of Other Funds</h5>
      <p>Non-City sources of Other Funds include grants from the Boston Planning and Development 
      Agency for roadway construction or other capital projects, as is the case with Harrison 
      Avenue and Connect Historic Boston. Other Funds also include incentive rebates provided by 
      utilities to carry out energy efficiency projects. Altogether, these City and non-City 
      sources of capital funds are estimated at $145.8 million.</p>
