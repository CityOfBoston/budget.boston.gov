    short_desc: >
      The capital plan is financed with general obligation bonds issued by the City, 
      other City funds, state grants, federal grants, and private grants.
    description: >
      General obligation bonds represent 61.1% of all project funding. This year’s 
      plan assumes $1.01 billion in new general obligation borrowings over the next 
      five years, a 4.6% increase to last year’s plan. This borrowing level remains 
      sustainable within the City’s debt affordability policy.

      State and federal financing represent 28.9% of all project funding. Programs, such 
      as the School Building Assistance program, Chapter 90 and the Transportation 
      Improvement Program, provide key resources for Boston’s Capital Plan. Funds for 
      capital financing are currently estimated at $353.2 million from State programs 
      and $349.8 million from Federal programs .

  - title: School Building Assistance Program
    body: >
      The School Building Assistance (SBA) program, administered by the Massachusetts 
      School Building Authority (MSBA), is an important revenue source for school renovation 
      and construction. <blockquote>Annually, the MSBA accepts new project requests from 
      cities, towns, and school districts, and if a project is ultimately approved, the MSBA \
      will pay 40% to 80% of eligible project costs.</blockquote>

      <h5>Renovations and construction</h5>
      <p>The MSBA operates two major programs – the Core Program and the Accelerated 
      Repair Program (ARP). Major renovation and new construction projects are funded 
      through the Core Program. The ARP funds roof, boiler, and window replacement projects 
      in school buildings that are otherwise sound. <blockquote>The City currently has four 
      projects in the Core Program — the Dearborn STEM Academy, the Boston Arts Academy, 
      and the Josiah Quincy Upper Pilot School, and the Carter School.</blockquote></p>
      <p>Construction of the new Dearborn STEM Academy is underway and will open for students 
      in September 2018. The MSBA has approved a maximum project grant totaling $37.4 million 
      which covers 50.8% of the current project budget.</p>
      <p>The City expects to enter into a Project Funding Agreement with the MSBA for the Boston Arts
      Academy project before the end of the fiscal year. The MSBA has approved a maximum project grant
      totaling $48.9 million, which covers 39.2% of the current $124.8 million project budget.</p>
      <p>The Josiah Quincy Upper School project is currently in the Feasibility Study phase. In December
      2017, the MSBA Board authorized an extension of time through December 31, 2020 to the Feasibility
      Study Agreement so that the City can further consider its site selection and to complete a new
      preliminary design program, a new preferred schematic report, and a new schematic design.</p>
      <p>The City’s Eligibility Period for the Carter School begins on July 2, 2018 and ends
      on March 29, 2019. During this time, the City must complete preliminary requirements established by
      the MSBA including forming a school building committee, completing an educational profile, agreeing
      on a planned enrollment level, and entering into a feasibility study agreement.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Other projects</h5>
      <p>The City has three projects underway through the Accelerated Repair Program. The City entered into a Project Funding Agreement last year for a window and door replacement project at seven schools. The MSBA’s maximum grant totals nearly $16.4 million. The total project cost is over $29 million. Construction will begin on the window project in June and is expected to be completed before the end of the calendar year.</p>
      <p>The City expects to complete roof and boiler projects at five schools later this year. The MSBA’s grant covers up to $6.4 million of the estimated $9.8 million project costs.</p>

    body: >
      Administered by the Massachusetts Highway Department, Chapter 90 funds are allocated by 
      formula through state bond authorizations and through the state budget to all cities and 
      towns in the Commonwealth. The City uses Chapter 90 funds to support its roadway resurfacing 
      and reconstruction programs as well as its sidewalk reconstruction programs. <blockquote>The 
      City anticpates an allocation of approximately $14.4 million in FY18.</blockquote>

  - title: Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
    body: >
      The Transportation Improvement Program is a statewide road and bridge construction 
      advertisement program developed under the management of the Massachusetts Department of 
      Transportation (MassDOT). It includes both local and state owned roads and bridges. 
      The TIP’s funding sources include state-issued general obligation bonds and federal 
      funds made available through the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation
      Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).

- text_col_2:
  - col: >
      <h5>City sources of Other Funds</h5>
      <p>Other Funds is a revenue category that includes both City and non-City sources.</p>
      <p>City sources of Other Funds include the Street Opening Account which funds the permanent 
      repair of utility cuts and pavement restoration. Transfers from the Surplus Property Fund, 
      Parking Meter Fund, and the General Fund are also categorized as Other Funds.</p>
      <p>In fiscal 2019, the City proposes transferring $53.8 million from the Parking Meter 
      Fund to the Capital Grants Fund and appropriating it for ten projects including:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>the construction of a new Long Island Bridge;
          <li>a Crosswalk and Lane Marking Revitalization initiative; and</li>
          <li>the reconstruction of Ruggles Street.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Using the Parking Meter Fund revenue in this way allows the City to make increased 
      investments in infrastructure at the same time that increased investment in the BuildBPS 
      program is supported by additional debt issuance.</p>
  - col: >      
      <h5>Non-City sources of Other Funds</h5>
      <p>Non-City sources of Other Funds include grants from the Boston Planning and Development 
      Agency for roadway construction or other capital projects, as is the case with Harrison 
      Avenue and Connect Historic Boston. Other Funds also include incentive rebates provided by 
      utilities to carry out energy efficiency projects. Altogether, these City and non-City 
      sources of capital funds are estimated at $243.5 million.</p>
