    short_desc: >
      Last year, Mayor Walsh announced Parks First, a comprehensive initiative 
      ensuring that Boston’s open spaces are among the nation’s most accessible 
      and equitable. 
    description: >
      In FY18, Boston will continue its commitment to achieving these goals through 
      investments in excellence in design and management. <blockquote>To date, the 
      Walsh Administration has increased the Parks Department’s operating funding 
      by $4.1 million or 23% and dedicated over $240 million in capital funds 
      to Boston’s parks. </blockquote>

      <h5>Jamaica Pond improvements</h5>
      <p>The reconstruction of pathways at Franklin Park will continue this year and be 
      completed by fall 2018.  Mayor Walsh will extend his commitment to usage and safety 
      of the Emerald Necklace with a $4.7 million pathway improvement around Jamaica Pond. 
      From the annual lantern parade, to the thousands of children who learn boating, 
      to the endless parade of walkers and joggers enjoying the 1.5 mile loop for 
      recreation, Jamaica Pond is a singular urban park experience.</p>

      <h5>Paul Revere Mall</h5>
      <p>Across town, a renovation of Paul Revere Mall in the North End will ensure that 
      this historic park is a welcoming and inviting place for residents and visitors. 
      The Paul Revere monument, along the Freedom Trail, is one of the most photographed 
      sculptures in Boston. This renovation will include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>restoration of the fountain and monument;</li>
          <li>accessible pathways;</li>
          <li>landscaping; and</li>
          <li>utility work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Inclusive design</h5>
      <p>Ninety-seven percent of Bostonians live within a ten-minute walk of a park, 
      but those spaces are only truly equitable if they serve the diverse needs of all 
      our residents. Mayor Walsh recognizes the need for inclusive design and has 
      created robust budgets for park renovation projects at:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/martins-park">Martin’s Park</a> in the Seaport;</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/improvements-smith-playground">Smith Playground</a> in Allston; and</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/improvements-mcconnell-playground">McConnell</a> and <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/improvements-garvey-playground">Garvey</a> Parks in Dorchester</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>Harambee Park</h5>
      <p>FY18 will bring the beginning of the renovation of the 45-acre Harambee Park. 
      The investment will include environmental improvements, pedestrian pathways, field 
      renovations and entrance improvements transforming Harambee into a premier example 
      of community-led comprehensive planning.</p>

      <h5>Street trees</h5>
      <p>Boston has routinely invested in its street trees.  FY18 will see a renewed 
      commitment with new funds allocated for the care of our park trees. Often Boston’s 
      largest and most mature, these trees are also our most active in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>urban cooling and CO2 capture;</li>
          <li>promoting air and water quality; and</li>
          <li>fighting topsoil erosion.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>This investment is critical to Climate Ready Boston.</p>

      <h5>Ball field renovations</h5>
      <p>Starting in FY18, Boston will invest in a rotation of small renovations to 
      neighborhood ball fields to keep them safe and playable. Between major renovations, 
      problems such as holes in batters’ boxes and unlevel fields can build up due to 
      consistent usage. This investment will allow the Parks Department to aerate, edge, 
      top dress, seed, and level ballfields every 5-7 years on a rotating basis. This new 
      investment builds on the Mayor’s commitment to excellent parks.</p>

      <h5>Park maintenance and safety</h5>
      <p>During his administration, Mayor Walsh has improved park maintenance and safety and 
      expanded the Parks Department’s recycling program.  This year, Boston will continue 
      to expand recycling into three signature parks, providing Bostonians with an 
      opportunity to act as stewards of their environment and complement the city’s 
      Climate Ready Boston.</p>      
  - col: >
      <h5>Recreation Division</h5>
      <p>Mayor Walsh also returned the Recreation Division to the Parks Department. 
      With that change the Parks Department has increased its free programming from 
      187 events to 820 in three years. Nearly all of these events are focused on 
      engaging youth in Boston’s open spaces.</p>
