      The City will launch a major capital project in FY18 to help preserve the 
      Library’s valuable and historic special collections in rare books and 
      manuscripts. 
    description: >
      This $15.7 million project will begin with the inventory of the Central 
      Library in Copley Square’s <a href="http://www.bpl.org/research/rb/">Rare Books 
      & Manuscripts Department</a>’s nearly 250,000 rare books and one million manuscripts.

      Over the course of the next two years, the Rare Books Department will receive 
      major environmental and mechanical improvements to better regulate temperature 
      and humidity control of the department’s collection storage areas, staff spaces, 
      conservation lab, and public reading room. Ultimately, the project will increase 
      accessibility to the Library’s rare books and manuscripts and ensure the 
      collections will be preserved for the future. <blockquote>The project continues the 
      City and the Library’s renewed commitment to improve intellectual control, 
      custodianship, and security of its special collections.</blockquote>
