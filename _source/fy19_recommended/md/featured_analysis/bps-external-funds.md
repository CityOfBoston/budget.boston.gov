      External funds are provided directly to BPS through formula grants (called entitlements), 
      competitive grants, reimbursement accounts, and other grants, primarily from state and 
      federal sources. 
    description: >
      These external funds are critical to the success of the district, but have decreased to 
      11% of total funding in FY18 from 17% in FY12 (Figure 3). Decreased external funding was 
      identified as a challenge to BPS’s long-term financial stability in the 
      <a href="http://bostonpublicschools.org/financialplan">Long-Term Financial Plan</a>. In recent 
      years, the BPS budget has relied on the increased City appropriation to help 
      absorb these decreases. <blockquote>Overall, BPS is expecting a decrease of $1.8 million, 
      or 1.4%, compared FY17.</blockquote>

      <h5>Title I entitlement grant</h5>
      <p>One of the largest sources of federal revenue for BPS is the <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/Page/5355">Title I entitlement grant</a>. 
      BPS is projecting $36.2 million in Title I revenue in FY18. The grant’s purpose is to improve 
      the academic achievement of the disadvantaged by ensuring that that all students have an equal 
      opportunity to obtain a high-quality education. The grant provides direct funds to schools with 
      higher levels of poverty.</p>
      <h5>Special education</h5>
      <p>BPS receives two external revenue sources to fund the district’s comprehensive <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/Domain/195">special 
      education program</a>. Through the Circuit Breaker reimbursements, the Commonwealth shares the 
      cost of educating students with disabilities once the cost to educate those students exceeds a 
      threshold amount. BPS is projected to receive approximately $15 million in Circuit Breaker revenue 
      in FY18.</p>
      <p>Additionally, funds provided through the federal <a href="http://idea.ed.gov/">Individuals 
      with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</a> grant enable the district to provide special 
      education in the least restrictive environment possible for children with disabilities 
      ages 3 through 21, and to provide early intervention services for children from birth 
      through age two. BPS is projecting to receive $17.9 million, or a 3.7% increase in IDEA 
      funds in FY18. </p>

      <h5>Help for turnaround schools</h5>
      <p>BPS anticipates $2.09 million in School Improvement Grants in FY18 from the Commonwealth. This 
      funding is provided to the lowest performing schools in BPS, also known as turnaround schools, 
      to extend the instructional day by at least 30 minutes, hold an additional 100 professional 
      development hours for teachers, and provide other school based support, such as after school 
      tutors and literacy coaches.</p>
      <p>In FY18, the district has applied for funding for:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school/grew-elementary-school">Grew Elementary</a>;</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school/dorchester-academy">Dorchester Academy</a>;</li>
      <li>Madison Park Technical Vocational High School;</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.excelhigh.org/">Excel High School</a>; and</li>
      <li><a href="http://bostonpublicschools.org/brightonhs">Brighton High School</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Additional funding</h5>
      <p>Although previous School Improvement Grants have expired, the district has shifted these 
      activities to the operating budget to continue the work of turning around low performing schools. 
      The FY18 budget includes an additional $750 thousand in funding to transition the 
      <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school/dearborn-middle-school">Dearborn</a> and 
      the <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/Page/6555">Mattapan Early Elementary School</a> 
      where previous School Improvement Grants have ended.</p>
      <p>As mentioned previously, an additional $1.25 million reserve will be set up for Level 3, 4, 
      and 5 schools that are experiencing declining enrollment.</p>
