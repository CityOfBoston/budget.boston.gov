      The FY18 Recommended Budget is supported by $3.14 billion in total 
      revenue, an increase of $143 million, or 4.8%, from budgeted FY17 
      total revenue. The FY18 Recommended Budget includes $3.1 billion 
      in recurring revenue and $40.0 million in non-recurring revenue.
    description: >
      Over the past decade, the City’s revenue structure has shifted 
      toward a growing reliance on property tax. Property tax, excise 
      taxes, and license and permit revenue lead local revenue growth 
      and are driven by an expanding economy. <blockquote>Ninety-three 
      percent of tax revenue growth is from locally derived sources such 
      as property tax and other local revenue.</blockquote>

      <h5>Property tax growth</h5>
      <p>Due to the strength of Boston’s property tax, growth exceeds 
      the average annual growth of 3% that Boston has seen over the past 
      decade and is able to support the growth in fixed costs and the City’s 
      investment in education. Property tax growth strength is expected to 
      continue in FY18, primarily due to the unprecedented strength of Boston’s 
      development climate.</p>
      <h5>Declining State revenue</h5>
      <p>Taxes paid by new construction is added onto Boston’s property tax levy, 
      which can otherwise increase by a maximum of 2 ½ percent, annually. Thus 
      while the City is projected to experience robust property tax growth in 
      FY18, that growth is offset by sluggish and unpredictable state revenue 
      growth.</p>

      <h5>Education spending</h5>
      <p>The share of net property tax has increased dramatically since FY08 
      while the share of state aid has steadily decreased.State revenue, the 
      City’s second largest revenue source, never recovered following the last 
      recession. In FY18, Boston’s state revenue is still $52.8 million, or 
      10.7%, lower than Boston’s state aid in FY08. While Boston’s spending on 
      education has increased substantially, Boston’s state education funding 
      has not kept pace. <blockquote>The Chapter 70 education aid formula does 
      not work for Boston, and thus Boston’s Chapter 70 growing by 0.6% or $1.3 
      million in the Governor’s proposed budget, a stark contrast to the $57.8 
      million more Boston expects to spend on education in FY18.</blockquote></p>

      <h5>Charter schools</h5>
      <p>Additionally, while Boston’s charter school assessment has risen by 155% 
      since the enactment of the 2010 Achievement Gap Legislation, the State’s 
      statutory obligation to fund charter school reimbursement has not kept 
      pace. As a result, the City of Boston is projected to lose $25 million 
      in the Governor’s FY18 budget, adding to the total lost revenue of $48 
      million over three years (FY15 - FY17).</p>

      <h5>Education finance reform</h5>
      <p>In light of the growing chasm between education costs and state revenue, 
      Mayor Walsh filed comprehensive education finance reform legislation that 
      aims to invest equitably in public education and expand access to 
      high-quality education for students of all ages by:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>proposing a creative revenue solution to provide every Boston 4-year 
      old a high-quality seat</li>
      <li>fixing the broken charter school transition funding model, and</li>
      <li>increasing BPS reimbursements for the highest-need students.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The proposals would increase annual education funding to Boston by $35 
      million in its first year of implementation. The proposal would also 
      position Boston to receive $150 million in additional annual Chapter 70 
      aid within a few years if the state identifies a new revenue source for 
      education.</p>

      <h5>Local receipts</h5>
      <p>Local receipts, which include revenues such as excises, fees, fines, 
      and permits, are projected to grow at $26.3 million, or 5.5%. Boston is 
      projecting strong room occupancy and meals excise revenue as well as 
      continued permit revenue growth from commercial and residential real 
      estate development and increased revenue from parking fines. The FY18 
      Budget also includes $2 million in new revenue as a result of the state 
      legislation that passed in 2016 to create a per-ride assessment collected 
      from transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft.</p>

      <h5>Maximizing local revenue tools</h5>
      <p>With limited revenue tools, the City is expanding its efforts in FY18 
      to better maximize the available local revenue tools. The FY18 budget 
      includes an additional $9.7 million identified in departmental revenues. 
      In FY18, the Office of Budget Management will initiate revenue audits to 
      verify the accuracy of information reported with certain fees. The City 
      anticipates recovering $2 million in additional revenue through these 
      audits. This City will also work to maximize federal health insurance 
      reimbursements.</p>
