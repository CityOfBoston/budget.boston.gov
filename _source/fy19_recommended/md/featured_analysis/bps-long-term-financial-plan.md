    short_desc: >
      In the Fall of 2015, representatives from BPS, the City of Boston, 
      Boston School Committee, Boston Teachers Union, parent groups and community 
      organizations began a yearlong effort that culminated with 
      <a href="http://bostonpublicschools.org/cms/lib07/MA01906464/Centricity/Domain/184/Investing%20in%20Student%20Success.pdf">the 
      release of the first report</a> in the BPS <a href="http://bostonpublicschools.org/financialplan">Long 
      Term Financial Planning effort</a> in November 2016.  
    description: >
      The goal of the plan is to unlock resources for future investment as the District’s 
      costs are outpacing future revenue growth. The plan describes five main drivers 
      that attribute to the yearly challenges that BPS faces.

    body: >
      <div class="intro-text supporting-text">The main drivers are transportation, district footprint, 
      salaries and benefits, student need, and federal and state revenue. To combat these issues ten ideas 
      were outlined within the report. The ideas include methods to potentially decrease 
      costs as well as increase revenue:</div>
- text_col_3:
  - col: >
      <ul>
       <li>Reduce long-distance BPS transportation by adjusting student 
       assignment policies</li>
       <li>Adopt State-Mandated Transportation-Eligibility Distances</li>
       <li>Maximize Efficiencies in Transportation</li>
       <li>Reconfigure the District’s Footprint</li>
       <li>Examine Teacher Wages and School Day Length</li>
      </ul>
  - col: >
      <ul>
        <li>Advocate for legislative changes related to teachers in 
        Suitable Professional Capacity roles</li>
        <li>Ensure Special Education Identification and Administration 
        Support Students Appropriately</li>
        <li>Streamline Central Office</li>
        <li>Advocate to Realign State Education Formulas</li>
        <li>Advocate to Give Boston More Flexibility to Modify its Revenue Structure</li>
      </ul>
  - col: >
      <h5>Focus on efficiency</h5>
      <p>The City and BPS have already commenced implementation of operational efficiencies 
      based on the findings outlined in the <a href="http://bostonpublicschools.org/financialplan">Long 
      Term Financial Plan report</a>. These will be highlighted later in the chapter. 
      The District continues to engage with the community and conduct additional analysis 
      on the other ideas under discussion, which have broader policy implications.</p>
