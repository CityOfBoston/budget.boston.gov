    short_desc: >
      As part of Boston’s implementation of Imagine Boston 2030, Mayor Walsh’s FY18-22 
      Capital Plan includes investments to support a healthy environment, reduce energy
      consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and prepare for climate change.
    description: >
      Leveraging outside funding, the Capital Plan allows for development of more 
      detailed climate plans for Boston neighborhoods, especially those most at 
      risk for coastal flooding, as recommended in Climate Ready Boston. <blockquote>These 
      plans are essential for protecting the safety and vitality of existing residents, 
      businesses, and institutions, and for ensuring the implementation of continued
      growth and development, as envisioned in Imagine Boston 2030.</blockquote>

    body: >
      Through Renew Boston Trust, Boston will undertake renovation projects to reduce 
      City buildings’ energy consumption and capture the resulting financial savings. 
      The City plans to finance the program with general obligation bonds payable in part 
      with the financial savings resulting from reduced energy consumption. The City will 
      implement the program through contracts with Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) that 
      will provide financial guarantees that the energy savings generated by the projects 
      will be sufficient to cover anticipated debt service costs.
