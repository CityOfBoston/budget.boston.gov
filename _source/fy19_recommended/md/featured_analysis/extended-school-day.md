      Based on a reform launched by Mayor Walsh in 2015, the district has been 
      extending the school day for kindergarten through 8th grade schools over 
      three years.
    description: >
      In the 2017-2018 school year, Boston is investing $14.2 million to allow 
      39 more schools and 15,000 more students to receive 40 minutes more each school 
      day through the implementation of Extended Learning Time (ELT). <blockquote>This 
      expansion brings the total number of students receiving extended learning to over 
      23,000 at 57 schools throughout the District at a total investment of $18.9 
      million.</blockquote>

      This investment will add 120 more hours, or the equivalent of 20 additional 
      school days a year, to kindergarten through 8th grade students. Previous to this 
      reform, students in traditional BPS elementary and middle schools are in class 
      for six hours and six hours and ten minutes, respectively, well below the national 
      average.

      <h5>Benefits of extended time</h5>
      <p>The extended time will help more students gain valuable learning and enrichment 
      opportunities. Schools with extended learning showed a “statistically significant” 
      positive effect in 5th grade science, 6th grade math, 8th grade science and 7th 
      grade English Language Arts, according to a statewide study in Massachusetts published 
      in 2012.</p>

      <h5>Comparing non-ELT schools</h5>
      <p>Students in ELT schools also outperformed their peers in non-ELT schools in growth 
      measurements on all MCAS tests. Teachers in the Mass. ELT program reported that the 
      extended day allowed them to accomplish their teaching goals and cover the instructional 
      material their students need to learn.</p>
