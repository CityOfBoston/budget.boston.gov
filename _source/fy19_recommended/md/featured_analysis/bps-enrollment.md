      Student enrollment is the foundation of the BPS budget. The preliminary stage of 
      the budget process involves enrollment projections for each program, grade, and 
      school, which are based on historic trends and current data. 
    description: >
      The projected enrollment at each school for the upcoming school year determines 
      the allocation of resources at the school level through the weighted student funding formula. 
      <blockquote>The FY18 budget development process included a more rigorous use of data 
      and collaboration between school leaders and BPS finance to develop accurate 
      enrollment projections.</blockquote>

      <h5>Enrollment numbers</h5>
      <p> In FY18, the BPS projected budgeted enrollment is approximately 57,200, including 
      an additional 100 prekindergarten seats.</p>
      <p>Overall enrollment has remained consistent over the past 5 years, ranging from a 
      high of 56,959 students in 2014-15, to a low of 56,404 in the 2016-2017 school year. 
      This trend is anticipated to continue.</p>

      <h5>Shifts in enrollment</h5>
      <p>At a school level, BPS has seen some shifts in enrollment. BPS gives parents a voice 
      in where their child attends schools, which means that they see shifts from year to year. 
      The <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/domain/162">BPS School Committee</a> 
      has also supported school communities that have requested to 
      expand grades in recent years, which have led to shifts in enrollment. It is projected that 
      600 more students will be enrolled in the District’s highest performing schools 
      next year.</p>
