      <p>In FY18, the Office of Budget Management will initiate revenue audits to verify the accuracy of information reported with certain fees. The City anticipates recovering $2 million in revenue through these audits. This City will also work to maximize federal health insurance reimbursements and address past due bills to recover revenue.</p>
      <p>The largest revenue source in this category is Municipal Medicaid 
      reimbursements for school health services. This federal reimbursement, 
      administered by the State, began in FY94. The City received $7.1 million 
      in FY15 and $8.2 million in FY16. <blockquote>Municipal Medicaid reimbursement 
      is expected to reach budget of $7 million in FY17 and increase to $7.25 
      million in FY18.</blockquote></p>
