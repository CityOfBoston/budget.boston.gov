      Most of the City’s general fund budget is supported by the revenues 
      that are estimated to come in during the course of the fiscal year, 
      including property tax, excises, state aid, and the various other 
      categories of revenues described above.

      Available funds are linked to a separate category of expenditure 
      appropriation - those supported by immediately available fund transfers.

      <h5>Parking meters and the cemetery trust</h5>
      <p>The only two significant available funds that the City generally 
      budgets each year are parking meter revenues to support the Transportation 
      Department, and cemetery trust monies which are used to support the City’s 
      maintenance of its public cemeteries. Both special funds have fees 
      collected during the course of the year. <blockquote>By transferring out less 
      than what is collected over the years, the City has built up the balances in 
      these funds.</blockquote></p>
      <p>Trust fund balances, such as the cemetery trust, also benefit from the 
      opportunity to invest in securities offering a higher return than short-term 
      fixed-income investments.</p>

        <h5>Transfers to the general fund</h5>
        <p>The City transferred $19.0 million from the parking meter fund to the general 
        fund in FY15 and did not transfer any funds in FY16.</p>
        <p>The City expects to transfer $22.5 million from the parking meter fund to the 
        general fund in FY17 and FY18. The City also plans to transfer $950 thousand 
        from the cemetery trust fund to the General Fund in FY17 and in FY18.</p>
