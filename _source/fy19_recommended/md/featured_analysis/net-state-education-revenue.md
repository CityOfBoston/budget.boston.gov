      The Long-Term Financial Plan also identified that stagnant state education 
      revenue, combined with the city’s steeply growing charter school assessments, 
      will continue to contribute to the district’s fiscal challenges. 
    description: >
      Over the past ten years, Boston’s net education aid has dramatically declined, 
      while education costs have rapidly climbed. While Boston now spends 40% of its 
      budget on education, state education aid now constitutes just 6.9% of total 
      revenue.

    body: >
      Chapter 70 Education Aid, the city’s main source of state education aid, does 
      not work for Boston. Despite the Commonwealth adding over $994 million to Chapter 
      70 Aid since FY08, Boston’s Chapter 70 Aid has increased by just $1.6 million 
      during this period.

      <h5>Charter school tuition reimbursement</h5>
      <p>Charter school tuition reimbursement was an important part of the 2010 Achievement 
      Gap Law that was meant to assist communities with the transition years as their 
      Commonwealth charter school costs increased. This is a critical source of revenue 
      for Boston because Boston’s charter school tuition costs have grown rapidly to a greater 
      percentage of the City’s net school spending than any other community in the state. 
      <blockquote>The charter school tuition reimbursement is subject to legislative appropriation, 
      and between FY15 and FY18, the Commonwealth has underfunded it, leading Boston to lose 
      a projected $73 million in revenue from the state in these three years combined.</blockquote> 
      Under the Governor’s H.2 budget, Boston is projected to lose an additional $25 million in FY18 due to the underfunding of this appropriation by the Commonwealth.</p>

      <h5>Charter school tuition assessment</h5>
      <p>While Boston’s state education revenue has been stagnant, its charter school tuition 
      assessment has grown dramatically. Since 2011, Boston’s charter school tuition assessment 
      has increased by 115%, or $106 million.  Boston is assessed by the Commonwealth to fund 
      charter schools on a per pupil basis. The assessment rises each year as charter school seats 
      open and students move to those schools.</p>
      <p>In addition, because the charter school tuition rate reflects the City’s spending in 
      support of public education, if spending on Boston Public Schools increases, the City’s 
      per pupil assessment increases as well.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Net state education funding</h5>
      <p>As BPS and charter school costs rise each year and state education aid remains stagnant, 
      the City’s contribution (net state education funding) to education in Boston has increased 
      by an average annual growth rate of 6.8% a year for the past five years (FY13-FY17). 
      More simply put, due to the absence of growth in state aid and the growing costs of BPS 
      and charter school tuition, Boston has been contributing a greater portion of its general 
      revenue to education every year at an unsustainable pace.</p>
