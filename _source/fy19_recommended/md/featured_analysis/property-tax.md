      The property tax levy has always been the City’s largest, providing 
      over two-thirds of all recurring City revenue, and most dependable 
      source of revenue and is fundamental to the financial health 
      of the City. 
    description: >
      In FY18 the net property tax levy (levy less a reserve for abatements) 
      totals $2.186 billion, providing 70.1% of recurring revenue. In FY19, 
      the net property tax levy is estimated to total $2.304 billion and 
      accounts for 70.8% of budgeted recurring revenues.

      <h5>Constraints on property tax revenue</h5>
      <p> Recently, property values in Boston have been increasing steadily. In FY16, 
      property values increased by $17.3 billion or 15.6%, and in FY17, property 
      values increased by $15.9 billion or 12.4% to $143.9 billion. However, in 
      Massachusetts Proposition 2 &frac12; constrains the amount of property tax revenue 
      the City can raise each year from its existing tax base. This means that 
      while the property values have grown 44% since FY14, property tax revenue 
      has only grown 17% due to proposition 2 &frac12;.<blockquote>While still maximizing 
      the City’s property tax revenue under Proposition 2 &frac12;, 
      Mayor Walsh and the Boston City Council expanded the residential exemption in 
      2017 which lowered Boston homeowner’s property tax in 2017. The change reduced 
      the average property tax bill for single-family, owner occupied homes by $299.</blockquote></p>

      <h5>New growth</h5>
      <p>During these same years, the levy has also been positively impacted by taxable 
      new value or “new growth.” New growth can arise from both real and personal property. 
      Thanks to efforts to attract business development to Boston and grow its housing 
      stock, Boston experienced unprecedented new growth property tax revenue in FY17, 
      which is outside of Proposition 2 &frac12;.</p>
      <p>Last year, the City saw construction projects in the Seaport District, the Longwood 
      Medical Area and the New Balance headquarters in Brighton Landing enter the tax base. 
      Residential development, which is linked to Mayor Walsh’s housing production goals, 
      accounted for 60% of the new growth. New growth is expected to be approximately $50 
      million in FY18, which is very high compared to historical levels of new growth 
      seen prior to FY17.</p>

      <h5>Limiting the total property tax levy</h5>
      <p>Proposition 2 &frac12; has been the overwhelming factor affecting the City’s property 
      tax levy since being passed in 1980. Proposition 2 &frac12; limits the property tax levy 
      in a city or town to no more than 2.5% of the total fair cash value of all taxable 
      real and personal property. It also limits the total property tax levy to no more 
      than a 2.5% increase over the prior year’s total levy with certain provisions 
      for new construction.</p>
      <p>Finally, Proposition 2 &frac12; provides for local overrides of the levy limit and a 
      local option to exclude certain debt from the limit by referendum. The City of 
      Boston has never sought a vote to either override the levy limitations or exclude 
      any debt from the limit. In each year since FY85, the City has increased its levy 
      by the allowable 2.5%. These increases have grown as the levy has grown, beginning 
      in FY85 at $8.4 million and reaching $50 million in FY18.</p>

      <h5>Property tax growth</h5>
      <p>Property tax growth from new growth has exceeded that from the allowable 2.5% 
      increase in 21 of the last 34 years. However, as was evident during the last 
      recession - new growth revenue is volatile, and depends on the development cycle.</p>
      <p>It is important for the financial health of the City that the property tax levy continues 
      to grow, but efforts continue to reduce reliance on the property tax through increasing 
      existing or establishing new local revenue sources as discussed in the previous section. 
      <blockquote>The percentage of the total tax levy being borne by residential taxpayers 
      increased from 36.2% to 38.6% between FY09 and FY17. This shift is due to the larger 
      increase in residential property values in the levy compared to commercial 
      property values.</blockquote></p>

      <h5>Positive signs</h5>
      <p>Indicators of the property tax in the current economy are improving as well. Office 
      vacancy rates, an indicator of commercial real estate value, are declining from their 
      peak. According to the firm Colliers International, the City had a vacancy rate of 11.3% 
      as of fourth quarter 2016. <blockquote>The median sales price, adjusted for inflation, 
      for a single-family home in Boston increased by 1.5% per year between the fourth 
      quarter 2006, $421,450, and the fourth quarter of 2016 $488,750, posting a 7.1% increase 
      from the fourth quarter in 2015.</blockquote></p>

      <h5>Proposition 2 &frac12; ceiling</h5>
      <p>Any significant decline in property values can present a problem for cities as dependent 
      on the property tax as Boston. As property values decreased in the early 1990’s, and the 
      City continued each year to maximize the allowable levy increase under Proposition 2 &frac12;, 
      the levy rapidly approached the levy ceiling of 2.5% of total assessed value.</p>
      <p>Reaching the 2.5% ceiling would have further limited the City’s capacity to increase 
      the annual levy.</p>
- text_col_2:
  - col: >
      <p>However, due to years of strong new growth increases, the City has some space between 
      its FY17 net effective tax rate of 1.45% and the tax levy ceiling of 2.5%. If the real 
      estate market were to depreciate, the City’s lack of proximity to the 2.5% property tax 
      rate threshold will insulate revenues from an immediate shock. However, if values were 
      depressed long enough, future growth of the property tax would be impaired.</p>
      <p>Tax collection remedies as prescribed by statute are utilized when taxes become 
      delinquent. The City’s ability to secure its right to foreclose by recording its tax 
      title lien at the Registry of Deeds is the most effective tool available for payment 
      enforcement. The property tax collection rate was 99.3% of the FY16 gross 
      tax levy as of June 30, 2016.</p>
