      Boston’s Performance Management efforts, driven in partnership between the Citywide 
      Analytics Team and the Budget Office, exist to ensure that the city delivers the most
      effective and efficient services possible.
    description: >
      We work with departments across the City to solve challenging problems, build a more 
      effective government, and deliver better outcomes for people who live and work in Boston. 
      This page highlights our approach, recent accomplishments, and plans for the upcoming year.

      <h5>Executive Insight</h5>
      <p>One of our top priorities is providing City leadership with performance data where and 
      when they need it. We provide the Mayor, Cabinet Chiefs, and City leadership with dashboards 
      and reports that provide up-to-date information so they can stay regularly informed about 
      the effectiveness of programs, day-to-day operations, and progress toward accomplishing 
      strategic goals.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Optimizing Process</h5>
      <p>Along with building the tools to understand how well the City is performing, we work 
      collaboratively across 14 Cabinets to help identify pain points and develop immediate and potential 
      long-term performance and process improvements. These direct engagements create lasting improvements 
      for the City.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Engaging with the Public</h5>
      <p>The public plays a critical role in our work. To promote transparency, we publish City and 
      departmental performance scorecards so people can see how the City is performing at delivering 
      services, and to encourage innovation, we share our data so the public can create new tools and 
      propose new ways for the City to deliver services.</p>

      <h5>Continued Development of CityScore</h5>
      <p>Launched in January of 2016, CityScore is designed to inform the Mayor, City managers, and the 
      public about quality of life and the performance of City government by aggregating key performance 
      metrics into one number. Over the course of the year, CityScore has improved the efficiency of core 
      City services, including increased resources for emergency medical services.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we developed a toolkit this year to make CityScore shareable so that any</p>
  - col: >
      <p>government or organization can recognize the same benefits that we have here in Boston.</p>
      <p><a class="button" href="https://github.com/CityOfBoston/CityScoreToolkit">View the toolkit</a></p>
      <h5>EMS Ambulance Allocation</h5>
      <p>We worked with Boston EMS to analyze how to best allocate resources in response to a growing call volume. Focusing on a subset of calls, incidents, and outcomes over multiple years, the analysis has prompted EMS to adjust the priority of calls to increase resource availability for higher-need medical incidents.</p>
  - col: 
    - blurb: >
        <p>We're also investigating how to increase ambulance response efficiency and levels of care for some of the City's most vulnerable residents.</p>

  - col: >
      <h5>311 Call Center Improvements</h5>
      <p>After noticing the 311 Call Center's CityScore was below 1, we worked with the team to build 
      dashboards and reports to better highlight performance trends and more quickly identify issues. To 
      supplement these tools, we also developed a broader performance improvement strategy that aims to 
      improve call center efficiency and increase constituent satisfaction, with implementation beginning 
      in early 2017.</p>

      Our work this year has also contributed to the following improvements:
- text_col_3:
  - col: >
      <ul>
      <li>Additional resources so our Emergency Medical Response team can better serve those in need of emergency services.</li>
      <li>A 5% increase in the average number of calls answered within 30 seconds at the 311 Call Center, resulting in more expedient customer service for those interacting with the City.</li>
      </ul>  
  - col: >
      <ul>
      <li>New Financial Insight Tools for the City to track progress toward cost saving measures and to ensure fair and equitable opportunities for those competing for city contracts.</li>
      <li>A 10% increase in the number of traffic signals repaired within 24 hours, ensuring that the City’s streets are safe and functioning properly.</li>
      </ul>  
  - col: > 
      <ul>
      <li>A clearer understanding of the demographics of city staff to help create a workforce that reflects our City’s residents.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Looking toward next year</h5>
      <p>Our work next year will continue to build upon the successes we’ve recognized this year 
      in the areas of customer service, permitting, recruitment, and public safety. You can learn more

      of city government, and informed the budget process.</p>
