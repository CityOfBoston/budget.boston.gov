      State aid to the City represents its second largest single source of 
      general fund revenue, although it has been declining as a share of recurring 
      revenue. The State also provides many grants that support city programs 
      and expenditures.
    description: >
      Often, changes to law or policy recommendations that affect City expenditures 
      and revenue generating capacity occur within or alongside budget language. As 
      a result, the state budget is of great interest to the City.

      <h5>Recent State Budget History</h5>
      <p>The State has faced several very difficult years of structural budget imbalance 
      and is facing more difficult years ahead despite recent revenue increases. The 
      State has made use of its stabilization or “rainy day” fund in addition to 
      reductions in expenditures and increases in revenue to deal with its structural 
      imbalance.</p>
      <p>At the close of FY08, the stabilization fund balance was approximately $2.1 
      billion. The State had drawn down the balance considerably by the close of FY10 
      to a low of about $670 million before revenues began to increase again in FY11. 
      The fund has since increased and stood at about $1.29 billion at the close of 
      FY16. The remaining balance at the end of FY17 is expected to be $1.30 billion.</p>

      <h5>FY18 State Budget</h5>
      <p>As the time of submitting Mayor Walsh’s proposed FY18 Budget, the State is 
      in the middle stage of development of its FY18 budget with only the Governor’s 
      budget having been submitted.</p>
      <p>The Governor’s budget includes a modest increase in state aid 2.5%, or $10.7 
      million. The Governor’s budget (H.1) increased Unrestricted General Government 
      Aid (UGGA) by 3.9%, or $7 million. UGGA is the main driver in the increase in 
      state aid in FY18, while Chapter 70 Education Aid only grew by 0.6%, or $1.3 
      million and Charter School reimbursements grew by $3 million, or 14%.</p>

      <h5>State charter school funding</h5>
      <p>While Boston’s charter school assessment has risen by 155% since the enactment 
      of the 2010 Achievement Gap Legislation, the State’s statutory obligation to fund 
      charter school reimbursement has not kept pace.</p>
      <p>As a result, the City of Boston lost $48 million over three years (FY15 – FY17). 
      Based on H.1, Boston is projected to lose another $25 million in FY18. Without a 
      change of course in how the state funds this critical local aid line item, the 
      City of Boston will be left to make difficult budgetary decisions that will impact 
      the quality of life for not only our residents but for the hundreds of thousands more 
      who work and visit this City every day.</p>

      <h5>Education finance reforms</h5>
      <p>Given these challenges, Mayor Walsh is building on his commitment to Boston’s 
      students and proposed <a href="http://bostonpublicschools.org/financialplan">transformative 
      education finance legislation</a> to expand access to high-quality education for 
      students of all ages. Mayor Walsh, partnering with 
      Boston’s State Legislators, proposed targeted state education finance reforms that 
      will increase annual funding to Boston by $35 million in its first year of implementation, 
      and position Boston to receive $150 million in additional annual Chapter 70 aid 
      within a few years if the state identifies a new revenue source for investments 
      in education.</p>
      <p>In concert with the <a href="http://bostonpublicschools.org/financialplan">Boston 
      Public School Long-Term Financial Plan</a>, the additional revenue will allow for 
      the continued expansion of investments necessary to support all of Boston’s children.</p>

      <h5>Education proposals</h5>
      <p>The package would unlock resources that would improve educational outcomes in Boston’s 
      district, charter, and non-profit settings. The proposals would:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>grant charter schools access to the Massachusetts School Building Authority and 
      relieve the State General Fund of the of the cost of charter facilities, creating 
      additional capacity for state funding for charter transition costs;</li>
      <li>streamline charter school transition funding in a way that limits state and 
      City costs; provide every Boston 4-year old with a high quality Pre-K seat;</li>
      <li>increase districts’ reimbursements for the highest-need and highest-cost students; and</li>
      <li>make transformational education funding available for Boston if the State 
      identifies a new education revenue source.</li>
      </ul>
