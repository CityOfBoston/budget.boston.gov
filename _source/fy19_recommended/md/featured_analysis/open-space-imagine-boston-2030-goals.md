    description: >
      Franklin Park renovations are already underway with investments in its pathways. 
      Renovation of its sister park, Harambee, for active recreation and commitment to 
      caring for its tree canopy, is also underway. <blockquote>Mayor Walsh has also committed to a 
      $28 million investment from the sale of the Winthrop Square garage to fully renovate 
      Boston’s largest park, which borders multiple neighborhoods.</blockquote> Special emphasis 
      will be made on access to, and activation of, arguably Boston’s most important

      <h5>Emerald Necklace</h5>
      <p>These improvements, combined with the current master planning of Moakley Park, serve as 
      anchor projects to launch the city’s efforts to complete the Emerald Necklace. Originally 
      envisioned by the Olmsted Corporation in the 1890s, the completion will be a community-led 
      modern interpretation of a green street, increasing connections in underserved areas 
      of our city.</p>

      <h5>Boston Common</h5>
      <p>In addition, Mayor Walsh has committed $28 million from the Winthrop garage sale to 
      augment the current historic levels of investment in Boston Common to fully renovate 
      America’s First Park. Major tourist destination, cultural beacon, and neighborhood 
      park, Boston Common is one of the most treasured green spaces in the world. This 
      investment will ensure future generations will enjoy the park in its full vibrancy.</p>
