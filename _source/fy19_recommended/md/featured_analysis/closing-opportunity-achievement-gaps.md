      Mayor Walsh and Superintendent Chang are committed to closing opportunity and achievement gaps. 
      Boston has made numerous research-driven investments and reforms in an effort to eliminate the 
      achievement gaps for students of color, English Language Learners, students with disabilities,
      and students in poverty.
    description: >
      <p>In FY18, Mayor Walsh will continue his successful campaign to expand BPS pre-kindergarten 
      (K1) seats and make an investment to establish a universal pre-k infrastructure.  With an 
      anticipated 100 additional K1 students to be served in FY18, Mayor Walsh will have added 422 
      K1 seats to BPS since he took office at a total investment of over $4.3 million. Mayor Walsh 
      has also filed early education finance legislation to close the “quality gap” in pre-kindergarten 
      eats in Boston by investing in programs at BPS and in community based organizations. 
      <blockquote>The Universal Pre-Kindergarten (UPK) taskforce estimates a 1,350 seat gap in Boston 
      between the number of quality seats — roughly 4,000 — and the current number of 4-year olds 
      (5,350).</blockquote> To dedicate $16.5 million to early education, this legislation would 
      redirect the surplus amounts generated by two Convention Center Fund revenues that are produced 
      exclusively in Boston.</p>

      <div class="intro-text supporting-text"><p>BPS will strengthen its commitment to Superintendent 
      Chang’s Excellence for All initiative that expands access to rigorous curriculum and enrichment 
      experiences for students, equipping them with new skills such as foreign languages and robotics. 
      By increasing the annual investment to $2 million, BPS will extend the program to 5th grade in 
      the 13 schools already offering Excellence for All to 4th graders, reaching a total of 1,569 
      students.  In FY17, BPS found that Excellence for All was successful in reaching the demographics 
      of students that are currently underrepresented in the 
      <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/Page/6525">Advanced Work Class (AWC) program</a>.</p></div>

      <p>In 2016, Mayor Walsh launched the 
      <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/tuition-free-college">Tuition-Free Community College Plan</a>, which offers 
      free tuition to low-income BPS students at <a href="http://www.rcc.mass.edu/">Roxbury Community College</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.bhcc.mass.edu/">Bunker Hill Community College</a>, and 
      <a href="http://www.massbay.edu/">Mass Bay Community College</a>. The Tuition-Free Community College Plan is 
      funded by the Mayor's Office of <a href="https://owd.boston.gov/">Workforce Development (OWD)</a> within 
      the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/planning-development-agency">Boston Planning & Development Agency</a>, 
      and the <a href="https://owd.boston.gov/tag/neighborhood-jobs-trust/">Neighborhood Jobs Trust</a>, 
      a public charitable trust funded by linkage fees generated by large-scale commercial building 
      projects in the city.</p>

      <p>The Boston Public Schools’ early-hiring initiative provides school leaders with flexibility 
      to put an effective teacher in every classroom. The initiative has also allowed BPS to hire
      candidates of color at disproportionately higher rates--during the 2016 hiring season, Black 
      and Latino educators were hired by schools at 2.2 and 1.9 times the rate of white educators
      respectively.</p>
