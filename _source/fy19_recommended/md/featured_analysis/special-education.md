      In FY18, the District will continue implementation of a special education data 
      management system. This data system will allow BPS to better manage and monitor 
      student's Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and ensure they are getting 
      the services they need.

      <h5>Out-of-district placements</h5>
      <p>In addition to mainstream or substantially separate placements in the District, 
      BPS is responsible for the educational services of approximately 498 students in 
      out-of-district placements. Students receive out-of-district placements when 
      their needs cannot be met in a public school setting, and instead a private 
      day school or private residential school is required to meet their educational 
      requirements.</p>

      <h5>Out-of-district costs</h5>
      <p> BPS is fully or partly responsible for paying for services for most of these 
      students at an average cost of $84,000 per year in FY16. Tuition rates are 
      established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Rate Setting Commission.</p>
