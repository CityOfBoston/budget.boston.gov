      The City annually collects a significant amount of recurring revenues 
      other than Property Tax or State Aid.

      <li>investment income</li>

    body: >
      <p>Many of the City’s local receipts are sensitive to existing economic conditions 
      and the City takes a cautious approach when estimating local receipts. Forecasts of 
      these revenue types are done by detailed econometric modeling or trending historical 
      collections, depending on the specific revenue source and the availability 
      of other data.</p>
      <p>The following is a brief description of selected local receipts and
      their expectations for FY18:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Motor vehicle excise revenue began to recover in FY14 and has remained steady 
      with the strengthening economy.  Revenue is estimated at $53.0 million in FY18.</li>
      <li>The Commonwealth granted municipalities a new 0.75% local option tax on 
      restaurant meals beginning October 1, 2009. The City expects to collect $26.0 
      million from this tax in FY18.</li>
      <li>Hotel excise revenue has benefited from an FY10 rate increase from 4% to 6%. 
      The City expects to receive $84.0 million in FY18.</li>
      <li>Jet Fuel excise collections are expected to decline to $22.0 million in FY18 
      due to low fuel price forecasts.</li>
      <li>As result of 2016 state legislation to create a per-ride assessment collected 
      from transportation network companies (TNCs), the City expects to 
      receive $2 million in FY18.</li>
      </ul>
  - col: >
      <ul>
      <li>In FY18 the City will reduce the amount required to maintain a compensating 
      balance (due to the need to offset credit card fees becoming unnecessary), and instead 
      invest this money. By standardizing practices and passing along the processing fees 
      at point of sale transactions, revenue from Interest on Investments is estimated 
      to increase to $2 million in FY18.</li>
      <li>Voluntary payment-in-lieu-of-tax agreements with non-profit institutions 
      (excluding the Massachusetts Port Authority) are expected to remain level. The 
      FY18 budget estimates $25.6 million in PILOT payments.</li>
      <li>License and permit revenues have been strong with the robust activity in the 
      City’s development pipeline.  Building permit revenue is conservatively budgeted 
      in FY18 at $45 million.</li>
      <li>Chapter 121A agreements are payments in lieu of tax for property under tax 
      agreements.  Those that qualify pay different taxes on income and property as 
      determined under Chapter 121A of Massachusetts General Law. 121A payments are 
      budgeted at $31.5 million in FY18.</li>
      <li>The FY18 budget includes an additional $9.7 million identified in departmental 
      revenues. In FY18, the Office of Budget Management anticipates recovering $2 million 
      through new revenue audits verifying the accuracy of information reported for 
      certain fees.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The remaining sources of recurring revenue to the City are set rates of fees, 
      fines, penalties and interest. These usually endure economic changes with small 
      changes in activity or revenue.</p>
