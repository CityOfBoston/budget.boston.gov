      In light of the growing chasm between education costs and state revenue, 
      <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/new-comprehensive-education-finance-reform-legislation">Mayor 
      Walsh filed comprehensive education finance reform legislation</a> that aims to 
      invest equitably in public education and expand access to high-quality education 
      for students of all ages. 
    description: >
      In addition to the internal changes recommended to be explored at BPS, the Long-Term 
      Financial Plan’s 10 Big Ideas included a call to “Advocate to Realign State Education 
      Formulas” and to “Advocate to Give Boston More Flexibility to Modify its Revenue 
      Structure.” Based on these findings, the Mayor is recommending comprehensive education 
      finance reform legislation that would increase annual available funding for Boston by 
      about $35 million for increased investment in education in its first year of 
      implementation.

      The package would fix the broken charter school finance model, more fully fund the cost 
      of the Commonwealth’s highest need students, and redirect existing tax revenue produced 
      in Boston back to its residents. In addition, if more state revenue becomes available 
      for education, the Mayor’s Chapter 70 Education Aid proposal would fundamentally change 
      Boston’s stagnant state education aid and provide an additional $150 million per year 
      to Boston students within several years.

      <h5>Charter School Transition Funding</h5>
      <p>To fix the broken Charter School Transition Funding Model, the Mayor’s proposed legislation would relieve the State General Fund of the cost of charter facilities, creating additional capacity for state funding for charter transition costs. The proposal also streamlines charter school transition funding in a way that limits state and city costs by committing the Commonwealth’s support for additional charter school seats by their providing:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>3 years of transitional funding directly to the charter schools (100% of the 
      tuition in year 1;</li>
      <li>50% in year 2; and</li>
          <li>25% in year 3, with the municipality responsible for the balance in Years 2 
          and 3 and thereafter).</li>
        </ul>
      <p>The legislation addresses a flaw in the current charter assessment formula that 
      directly penalizes communities that have had their charter reimbursement appropriations 
      underfunded. Finally, it grants charter schools access to the Massachusetts School 
      Building Authority.</p>

      <h5>Universal Pre-Kindergarten</h5>
      <p>The Universal Pre-Kindergarten taskforce estimates a 1,350 seat gap in Boston between 
      the number of quality seats — roughly 4,000 — and the current number of 4-year olds (5,350). 
      In order to provide every Boston 4-year old with a high quality Pre-Kindergarten seat, 
      the Mayor proposed legislation dedicating $16.5 million to early education.</p>
      <p>The proposed legislation redirects the surplus amounts generated by revenue from two 
      Convention Center Fund that are produced exclusively in Boston, the Boston Sightseeing 
      Surcharge and the Boston Vehicular Rental Transaction Surcharge.</p>

      <h5>Students with disabilities</h5>
      <p>Boston Public School students face more significant and more numerous disabilities 
      than students in other districts.</p> <blockquote>BPS’s students in out of district educational 
      programs cost an average of $84,000 per pupil. Currently, the state is intended to reimburse 
      districts for 75% of costs above 4 times the statewide average foundation per pupil rate.</blockquote>
      <p>In order to increase districts’ reimbursements for the highest-need and highest-cost students, 
      the Mayor has proposed legislation that would change this threshold to 3 times the average 
      pupil cost.</p>

      <h5>Transformational education funding</h5>
      <p>The Mayor has also proposed legislation to make transformational education 
      funding available for Boston if the State identifies a new education revenue source. 
      The proposal fixes the Chapter 70 Education Aid Formula for communities like Boston 
      that serve the Commonwealth’s most economically disadvantaged students, are investing 
      more in their students than is required, but are receiving stagnant education aid each year.
      If new state revenue is identified for education aid, the proposal caps the municipal 
      revenue growth factor at 2 &frac12; for communities like Boston, and implements needed foundation 
      budget updates for economically disadvantaged students, special education, and English 
      Language Learning.</p>
      <p>Boston could fundamentally change its State Education Aid picture and invest an 
      additional $150 million per year in its students within the next several years. While Boston’s 
      spending on education has increased substantially, our state education funding has not 
      kept pace.</p>

      <h5>Kindergarten Expansion Grants</h5>
      <p>Additionally, the Mayor is advocating for restoring funding for Kindergarten Expansion
      Grants that was cut in the FY17 state budget. This line item was a critical source of revenue 
      assisting BPS in providing access to full day kindergarten to all five year olds in Boston.<p> 
      <blockquote>This year, BPS had to divert funding to minimize the impact of this $1.8 million 
      cut on students, funding that could have been used to expand learning hours or K1 seats, 
      and for many other purposes.</blockquote>
