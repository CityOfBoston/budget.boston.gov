      In general, the Cityâ€™s level of investment income is a function of prevailing short-term interest rates and daily cash balances. Since 2007, interest rates have been reduced in an effort to stimulate the economy.

        <p>In FY18 the City will reduce the amount required to maintain a compensating 
        balance (due to the need to offset credit card fees becoming unnecessary), and 
        instead invest this money. By standardizing practices and adding fees to the 
        cost of point of sale transactions, revenue from Interest on Investments is 
        estimated to increase to $2 million.</p>
        <p>Given the very low interest earnings potential of recent years, the Treasury 
        department had instead engaged in a compensating balance approach with banks, 
        having fees paid through depositing minimum balances. <blockquote>Investment income 
        totaled $61 thousand in FY15 and $184.3 thousand in FY16. The City projects interest 
        income will exceed the $200 thousand budgeted in FY17.</blockquote></p>
