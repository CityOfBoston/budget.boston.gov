      A city can control only so much of its economic condition in the near term. 
      And a city’s economic condition can positively or negatively affect its
      ability to raise revenue.
    description: >
      As such, the state and national economies are of great importance to the
      City’s well-being. The nation’s economic recovery is gaining momentum from 
      a deep recession that officially ended almost eight years ago in June 2009.

    body: >
      <p>Since the recession, the U.S. economy has grown in fits and starts since 
      June 2009 as evidenced by GDP growth. Accommodative monetary policy and extended 
      unemployment insurance have back-stopped any slide back into recession. But recently, 
      the housing sector has gained steam and other economic variables seem to be 
      stabilizing and beginning to grow.</p>

        <h5>Gross Domestic Product</h5>
        <p>Overall economic value as measured by real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been 
        positive, but growth has been relatively slow. For all but two of the thirty quarters after 
        the recession’s official end in the second quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter 
        of 2016, real GDP growth has been positive but only averaging 0.5%. The Federal Reserve 
        reaffirmed estimates of moderate economic growth, with real GDP forecast to grow between 
        1.7% to 2.3% for the calendar year 2017 and 1.7% to 2.4% for 2018.</p>

        <h5>Unemployment rate improving</h5>
        <p>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the U.S. has been steadily decreasing 
        since the end of the recession. The unemployment rate was 4.7% in February, near its 
        recent low. <blockquote>According to Federal Reserve estimates, the unemployment rate is 
        expected to continue improving, falling to a range 4.4% to 4.7% in calendar year 2017 
        and to a range of 4.2% to 4.7% in 2018.</blockquote></p>

        <h5>Inflation estimates</h5>
        <p>Inflation has been below the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. The Federal Reserve 
        projects that inflation will range from 1.7% to 2.1% in 2017 and range from 1.8% to 
        2.1% in 2018.</p>

        <h5>Federal funds rate</h5>
        <p>Despite the improvements in the labor market and the expectation that inflation would 
        rise to its target of 2%, the Federal Reserve forecasts that economic conditions will 
        evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases to the federal funds rate. 
        In December 2015, for the first time since 2008, the Federal Reserve increased the Federal 
        Funds target rate by 0.25%, to a target range of 0.25% to 0.50%. <blockquote>The Federal 
        Reserve increased the Federal Funds target rate in December 2016 by 0.25%, to a target range 
        of 0.50% to 0.75% and again in March 2017 by 0.25%, to a target range of 0.75% to 1.0%. 
        The Fed’s benchmark rate, after these modest increases, is still quite low by 
        historical standards.</blockquote></p>
