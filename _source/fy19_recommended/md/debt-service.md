        The City benefits from its strong financial policies and practices and has recently been 
        affirmed with triple A bond ratings from Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s. Strong bond 
        ratings are an assessment of the City’s long-term financial stability and lower the cost 
        of borrowing. <blockquote>As the City borrows more over ten years to support investments 
        in its schools, debt service is projected to increase as well. In FY18 Debt Service is 
        budgeted at $185.6 million, a 6.1% increase over the previous year. </blockquote> For
