      The Reserve budget is a fixed cost stipulated by state law and requires 
      the City of Boston to maintain a reserve of 2.5% of the prior year 
      appropriations, not including the School department, on its balance sheet.  
    description: >
      The current balance of this reserve is $31.4 million, and the City is required 
      to budget $1 million in FY18 to meet reserve requirements. <blockquote>The reserve can be 
      used to provide for extraordinary and unforeseen expenditures and the Mayor 
      may make drafts or transfers against this fund with City Council approval after 
      June first of each fiscal year.</blockquote> Since the establishment of this reserve, the 
      City has yet to make any drafts or transfers from the reserve.
