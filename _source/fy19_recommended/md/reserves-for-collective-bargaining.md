      Collective bargaining is the process of negotiations between the City administration and bargaining units (unions).
    description: >
      Most union contracts in City departments expired in FY17. Salary increases in these agreements will have a major impact on dollars available in FY18 and in the upcoming years. The FY18 collective bargaining reserves, a $20 million reserve for Boston Public Schools and a $27 million reserve for City departments including the Public Health Commission, contain funding for successor agreements.  These reserves account for $31 million of the growth in the FY18 Budget.
