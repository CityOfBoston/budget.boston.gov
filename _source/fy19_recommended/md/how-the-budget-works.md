      <p>The City of Boston's budgeting process takes at least 6 months to do, but 
      that doesn't mean you can't understand it in 90 seconds. Below, find a 
      quick video overview of how Boston's budget works. If you want more detail, 
      read the text below the video.</p>

      <p>The City of Boston’s budget process is governed by the City’s Charter* and practices designed to provide transparency and gather public feedback. The chief executive officer of the City is the Mayor. Martin J. Walsh, the Mayor of the City, was elected to serve his first term from January 2014 through January 2018. The Mayor has general supervision of and control over the City’s boards, commissions, officers, and departments. The portion of 
      the budget covering appropriations for all departments and operations of 
      the City, except the Boston Public Schools, is prepared under the direction 
      of the Mayor. The Boston Public Schools follow a separate process which 
      requires the Superintendent of Schools to propose a budget to the School 
      Committee. The Superintendent submits the School Committee approved budget 
      to the Mayor. The Mayor submits a recommended budget, including the Boston 
      Public Schools budget, to the City Council.</p>
      <p>The legislative body of the City is the Boston City Council, which consists 
      of thirteen members serving two-year terms. Four councilors are elected at-large 
      and nine are elected from geographic districts. The City Council may enact 
      ordinances and adopt orders that the Mayor may either approve or veto. Ordinances 
      and orders, except orders for the borrowing or appropriation of money, may be 
      enacted by the City Council over the Mayor’s veto by a two-thirds vote. The 
      City Council may reject or reduce a budget submitted to it by the Mayor, but 
      may not increase it.</p>
      <p>* Chapter 486 of the Acts of 1909, and Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948 of the 
      Commonwealth which, as amended, constitute the City’s Charter.</p>

    body: >
      <p>The City of Boston presents a fully integrated budget - including capital, 
      operating, and external funds - to show the total funding available to 
      departments to fulfill their missions. The operating budget funds personnel 
      and nonpersonnel expenses to departments so that they may provide important 
      city services. The capital budget funds new construction or renovations to 
      existing city-owned facilities (e.g., police and fire stations, school 
      buildings), infrastructure improvements (e.g., roads, sidewalks, lights), 
      and major equipment purchases such as fire-fighting apparatus. The external 
      funds budget describes the projects and programs that will be undertaken in 
      the next fiscal year with funding received from the state, federal, or other 
      non-general fund sources.</p>

    body: >
      <p>The City of Boston’s program budget provides information related to City services and their associated costs. The operating and capital budgets present the recommended resource allocations in terms of personnel, facilities, goods, and services. The budget document also describes the services provided by each City department and the performance targets that have been set for FY18.</p>
      <h5>Departmental Operating Budgets</h5>
      <p>Activities and services of the City are grouped into programs for budgeting and management purposes. The operating budget for each department is presented by program. A “program” is defined as an organized group of activities directed toward attaining one or more related objectives, and the resources to execute them.</p>
      <p>A program can consist of direct services to the public and neighborhoods of 
      the City (e.g. police patrol or tree maintenance), or traditional city staff 
      functions (e.g. administrative services or engineering and design). Some City 
      activities may not be defined as separate programs, even though they may be 
      self contained operations. For example, a fire station is not a separate program, 
      although for accounting purposes it is a cost center within the Fire Department’s 
      Fire Suppression program. Program budgets serve as the basic building blocks of 
      the budget. There are three additional organizational levels above the program 
      level in the budget. The three levels are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The Division Level for units within some departments.</li>
      <li>The Department Level, which includes departments, commissions, and other 
      offices.</li>
      <li>The Cabinet Level, which includes functionally-related departments.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Description of Organization and Definition of Categories</h5>
      <p>This section outlines the information reported within each department and 
      program in the budget.</p>
      <h5>Department or Division Level</h5>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Department Mission:</strong> The mission statement is a fundamental 
      statement of purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Goals:</strong> These goals represent stated aims for which the departmentor division is held accountable.</li>
      <li><strong>Description of Services:</strong> The description of services provides 
      a general overview of the department and its responsibilities, and lists examples 
      of major services provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Authorizing Statutes:</strong> This section lists statutes and 
      ordinances that create departments as well as endow them with legal powers.</li>
      <li><strong>Operating Budget:</strong> The operating budget presentation includes 
      a table displaying total operating and external budgets by program beginning with 
      FY15 actual expenses through the FY18 budget.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Program Level</h5>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Program Description:</strong> This section presents a general overview 
      of the program, including its responsibilities and major services provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Program Goals:</strong> Each program identifies the department goals related to the efforts of the program to 
      further the department’s mission.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Measures:</strong> Performance measures demonstrate a 
      program’s progress in implementing their strategies. Performance measures may gauge 
      workload, effectiveness, efficiency, or productivity. Some performance measures also 
      show the changing context in which programs are working.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Financial Data</h5>
      <p>The financial data tables identify the major groups and expenditure account codes 
      (for example, Personnel Services/Overtime, Supplies and Materials/Office Supplies), 
      historical expenditures in each, and the proposed appropriations in each group and 
      account in FY18. Two financial data sheets are provided for the FY18 operating 
      budget: Department History and Department Personnel.</p>
      <h5>Department History</h5>
      <p>Expenditure account codes are listed within six expenditure groups. Dollar amounts 
      are shown for:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>FY15 actual expenditures,</li>
      <li>FY16 actual expenditures,</li>
      <li>FY17 appropriations,</li>
      <li>FY18 adopted budgets, and</li>
      <li>The difference between the FY17 appropriation and the FY18 adopted appropriation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>External Funds</h5>
      <p>Historical expenditures and the proposed appropriations in these 
      accounts in FY18 are shown. External Funds Projects lists a 
      description of each project’s mission.</p>
      <h5>Capital Budget</h5>
      <p>The capital budget section provides an overview of projects and major initiatives for 
      departments charged with managing facilities and major equipment assets. Dollar amounts 
      are shown for:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>FY15 actual capital expenditures,</li>
      <li>FY16 actual capital expenditures,</li>
      <li>FY17 estimated capital expenditures,</li>
      <li>FY18 projected capital expenditures</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following this overview are capital project profiles, including descriptions of each project mission, the department managing the project, the status and location of each project, and if there are operating budget impacts. A table summarizes the total capital funds authorized for projected expenditures in FY18 and for future years, as well as whether the source is City authorization or other funding such as federal and state infrastructure grants or trust funds. A listing of actual and planned capital expenditures in comparison to authorized dollars is also provided.</p>
