The purpose is to create and implement a mini grant program for Neighborhood Beautification projects. Love Your Block going forward in FY18 will also include Boston Shines, a spring clean up initiative that is funded by external donations. As a result the funding sources from here on out are external donations for the entire Love Your Block account. This is an annual fund. For FY17 Love your Block account will be used for mini grants only and is projected to spend 10,500."
