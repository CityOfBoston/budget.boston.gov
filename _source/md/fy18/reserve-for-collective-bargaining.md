      Collective bargaining is The process of negotiations between the City administration and bargaining units (unions) regarding the salary and fringe benefits of city employees.
    description: >
      Most union contracts in City departments expire at the end of FY16 or shortly thereafter. Salary increases in these agreements will have a direct impact on dollars available in FY17 and in the coming years. The FY17 collective bargaining reserve includes limited funding for successor agreements for those unions.
