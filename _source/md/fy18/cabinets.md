      <div>"This budget is a manifestation of my vision for a
      Thriving, Healthy, and Innovative Boston."</div>
      <div>- Martin J. Walsh, Mayor</div>
    description: >
      Mayor Walsh presented a balanced budget that maintains
      high levels of support in critical areas such as education
      and public safety, makes limited strategic investments,
      continues the City's commitment to addressing its long-term
      liabilities, and builds on the Administration's record of
      strong fiscal management. This is made possible by the
      Administration's achievement of efficiencies and savings.
      The City's data-driven managerial approach was recently
      validated by the affirmation of Boston's triple A bond rating.
