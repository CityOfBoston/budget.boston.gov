      Throughout his Administration, Mayor Walsh has dedicated increased resources for 
      helping those in need of substance use and addiction supports, including 55 
      clinicians, outreach workers, homeless caseworkers and coordinators and other 
      recovery staff at the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC). 
    description: >
      In August 2015, he created the Mayor’s Office of Recovery Services (ORS), the 
      first municipal office in the U.S. solely dedicated to addressing substance use 
      and addiction. In the past year, ORS initiated a partnership with Boston Fire, 
      Police, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to provide recovery resources to 
      residents following overdoses and teamed up with UMass-Boston to support 
      its Student Recovery Communities.

      <h5>311 for Recovery Services</h5>
      <p>Last year, the Mayor launched 311 for Recovery Services, the City of Boston's 
      new hotline support system designed to help people struggling with substance use and 
      addiction to access recovery resources. The investment linked 311 service with the 
      PAATHS (Providing Access to Addictions Treatment, Hope and Support) 
      Program, a one-stop shop for individuals, families, community partners, and 
      other treatment providers looking for information about, or access to, 
      addiction treatment services. <blockquote>Due to this investment, PAATHS has seen 
      a 50% increase in calls and a 74% increase in walk-ins, while the number of new 
      patients accessing services has doubled.</blockquote></p> 
      <h5>PAATHS program</h5>
      <p>In FY18, the City will build on the success of the PAATHS program and enable it 
      to expand services to evenings and weekends. This new investment, which includes 
      funding for three Public Health Advocates, a Clinician, and a Program Director, 
      allows the program to remain open until 7:00 pm on weekdays and from 
      9:00 am to 4:00 pm on weekends.</p>
