      The Commonwealth imposes an excise in-lieu of property tax on motor 
      vehicles, the proceeds of which are received by the municipality where 
      the vehicle is principally kept. 
    description: >
      The excise is a uniform rate of $25 per $1,000 of vehicle valuation. 
      Valuations are determined by a statutorily-defined depreciation schedule 
      based on the manufacturer’s list price and the year of manufacture.

      <h5>Motor vehicle excise tax</h5>
      <p>Motor vehicle excise revenue totaled $53.0 million in FY14, $53.0 
      million in FY15 and $67.6 million in FY16. The City budgeted $53.0 million 
      in FY17 and FY18 for motor vehicle excise revenue. Since the excise tax 
      lags the sale of the vehicle, this revenue estimate is generated based 
      on state projections of current year tax collections on motor vehicle 
      sales in the Commonwealth.</p>
      <h5>Meals excise revenue</h5>
      <p>The Commonwealth granted municipalities a new local option tax on 
      restaurant meals beginning October 1, 2009. The City adopted this tax and 
      collected $25.9 million in FY15 and $28.0 million in FY16. The City 
      budgeted $26.0 million in FY17 and FY18 for meals excise revenue. This 
      revenue is estimated using the income of area residents, employment numbers 
      for local restaurants, expected local room occupancy excise revenues (a 
      driver of restaurant meals), and historical trends.</p>

      <h5>Room occupancy excise</h5>
      <p>The local room occupancy excise amounts to 6.0% of the total amount of 
      rent for each hotel or motel room occupied. This rate was increased in the 
      fall of 2009 from 4.0%, along with the enactment of the new meals tax. Another 
      5.7% excise tax is directed to the state general fund and another 2.75% fee 
      to the state’s convention center fund, for a total tax from all sources on 
      hotel rooms in the City of 14.45%. <blockquote>Room occupancy excise revenue 
      to the City totaled $83.5 million in FY15 and $89.1 million in FY16. The City 
      expects to exceed the $80.0 million budgeted in FY17 due to very strong 
      hotel bookings.</blockquote></p>
      <p>The FY18 budget estimates an increase to $84.0 million. Room occupancy 
      excise receipts are estimated based on air travel statistics from Logan 
      International Airport, leisure and hospitality employment numbers, and the 
      consumer price index for recreation for Boston.</p>

      <h5>Vehicle rental surcharges</h5>
      <p>The vehicle rental surcharge is a revenue-sharing arrangement with the 
      Commonwealth. Under this arrangement, all vehicle rental contracts originating 
      in the City are subject to a $10 surcharge. The City receives $1 of 
      this surcharge.</p>
      <p>The City received $300 thousand in FY15 and $1.6 million in FY16. In FY17, 
      the City expects to exceed the budgeted $1.3 million and the FY18 budget 
      assumes an increase to $1.5 million.</p>

        <h5>Jet fuel excise revenue</h5>
        <p>The excise on the sale of jet fuel is 5% of the average sales price of 
        the previous quarter, but not less than five cents per gallon. Increases in 
        fuel prices lead to increased jet fuel excise revenue. Jet fuel prices have 
        decreased sharply from their peak in FY12:</p>
    - img: /img/featured_analysis/pages/recurring-local-receipts.png
    - blurb: > 
        <ul>
        <li>Jet fuel excise revenue totaled $29.7 million in FY15 and $36.8 million in FY16 due to a late payment from FY15.</li>
        <li>The City budgeted $27.7 million in FY17 and the FY18 budget estimates a decrease to $22.0 million as low fuel prices are expected to continue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Estimates incorporate fuel price forecasts from the Energy Information 
        Administration (EIA) and air traffic volume from Logan International Airport.</p>

      <h5>Transportation network companies</h5>
      <p>In August 2016, Governor Charlie Baker signed bipartisan legislation creating 
      a statewide regulatory framework for transportation network companies (TNCs). 
      In addition to creating regulations for the industry, the law creates a $0.20 
      per-ride assessment collected from TNCs that by statute shall not be charged to 
      a rider or driver and sunsets after ten years. <blockquote>The City of Boston 
      will receive half of the per-ride assessment, or $0.10, for each ride 
      originating in Boston. The FY18 budget estimates $2 million in new revenue 
      from the per ride assessment.</blockquote></p>
