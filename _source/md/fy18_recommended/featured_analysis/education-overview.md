      The City of Boston is investing in its students to invest in its future. 
      Education comprises 40% of the FY18 budget with a projected $1.081 billion 
      to support Boston Public Schools and $174.3 million to support approximately 
      10,600 Boston students in charter schools.
    description: >
      Education also comprises 40% of the growth in the budget, with an increase 
      of $57.8 million (4.8%) over FY17. This increase is in spite of a projected 
      increase of just $1 million in Chapter 70 Education Aid and a charter reimbursement 
      that is projected to be $25 million underfunded from the state.

    body: > 
      This spring, the School Committee approved a $1.061 billion budget for the Boston 
      Public Schools. At a $1.061 billion appropriation plus a <a href="https://budget.boston.gov/operating-budget/reserve-for-collective-bargaining/">$20 million collective bargaining reserve</a>, 
      this marks the largest Boston Public Schools budget in history.  
      With this investment, Mayor Walsh has increased funding for the Boston Public 
      Schools’ annual budget by $143 million since taking office. <blockquote>Funding directed 
      to schools will increase by almost 4%, even before the largest driver of BPS costs, 
      employee collective bargaining increases, are negotiated, a $25 million increase 
      over FY17.</blockquote>

      <h5>Closing the opportunity and achievement gap</h5>
      <p>In FY18, Boston Public Schools is proposing to make important research-backed 
      investments to close the opportunity and achievement gap.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Boston is investing $14 million to give 15,000 students, from 
          kindergarten through 8th-grade, 120 additional hours of learning time — or 
          the equivalent of 20 more school days a year.</li>
          <li>In addition, by strengthening BPS’s commitment to Excellence 
          For All, more students in the fourth and fifth grade will receive the same 
          rigorous instruction and enriched learning opportunities as those in Advanced 
          Work Class (AWC).</li>
          <li>Boston is also making a strategic $1.2 million investment to support 3,000 BPS 
          students identified by the district as experiencing homelessness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>BPS will also be providing lower performing schools with a wide-range of 
        differentiated supports, which total over $16 million. This includes a new $1.25 
        million reserve focused on supporting low level 3, 4 and 5 schools with 
        declining enrollment.</p>

      <h5>Long-Term Financial Planning project</h5>
      <p>Stemming out progress in the District’s Long-Term Financial Planning project, the 
      FY18 budget also includes several central office and transportation efficiencies. 
      Efforts to tighten budget management and identify efficiencies, along with Mayor Walsh’s 
      commitment to education funding, make possible $20M of BPS investments. While the School 
      Committee approved a balanced budget for FY18, the District still has underlying 
      challenges that require structural changes to allow Boston to continue to effectively 
      invest in its students in future years.</p>
