      In general, the City’s level of investment income is a function of 
      prevailing short-term interest rates and daily cash balances. Since 
      2007, interest rates have been reduced in an effort to stimulate the 
      economy.
    description: >
      Given the very low interest earnings potential of recent years, the Treasury 
      department had instead engaged in a compensating balance approach with banks, 
      having fees paid through depositing minimum balances. <blockquote>Investment income 
      totaled $61 thousand in FY15 and $184.3 thousand in FY16. The City projects interest 
      income will exceed the $200 thousand budgeted in FY17.</blockquote>

      <p>In FY18 the City will reduce the amount required to maintain a compensating 
      balance (due to the need to offset credit card fees becoming unnecessary), and 
      instead invest this money. By standardizing practices and adding fees to the 
      cost of point of sale transactions, revenue from Interest on Investments is 
      estimated to increase to $2 million.</p>
