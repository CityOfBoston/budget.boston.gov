    short_desc: >
      In FY18, Mayor Walsh will launch a data-driven initiative to change the 
      way Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) are deployed. 
    description: >
      Working with the Citywide Analytics Team, Boston EMS identified the particular 
      911 incident types that warranted the most ambulances responses that did 
      not end up requiring a transport.

      <h5>Utilizing dispatch data</h5>
      <p>Calls that don't end up requiring a transport result in a twofold 
      challenge for Boston: not only do these calls tie-up ambulances for a 
      low-acuity patients, but they prevent ambulances from responding to 
      other calls. <blockquote>Utilizing dispatch data, EMS also found 
      that these call types are clustered in certain areas of the city.</blockquote> 
      The clustering of these incidents suggests that they warrant a different type of 
      emergency medical care. As a result, the FY18 budget includes funding for a 
      Community Assistance Team to pursue a more agile and proactive response 
      to emergency services.</p>

      <h5>Putting the funding to work</h5>
      <p>FY18 funding enables EMS to hire EMTs that will be deployed on rotating schedules 
      in non-transport vehicles to triage call types in Downtown Boston and the Recovery 
      Road area. Working in coordination with the City’s outreach street teams, the responding 
      unit will assess the acuity of the patient and the need for an ambulance 
      transport to the hospital.</p>

      <h5>Community Assistance Team</h5>
      <p>If an ambulance transport is unnecessary, the Community Assistance Team will 
      work with other existing city programs to ensure the patient is directed to the most 
      appropriate services, when necessary.  This approach will result in better patient 
      outcomes in addition to improving ambulance utilization by only dispatching ambulances 
      when a transport is required.</p> 
  - col: >
      <h5>Reducing response times</h5>
      <p>The Community Assistance teams build on the Administration’s FY17 investment to 
      reduce EMS response times by adding 20 EMTs and purchasing 10 replacement ambulances. 
      Thanks to Boston's investment in 20 EMTs in FY17, this year’s budget achieves a 10% 
      reduction in EMS overtime and an 8% increase in EMS third party billing revenue. 
      These changes generate a $4.1 million net savings for the City in FY18. </p>
