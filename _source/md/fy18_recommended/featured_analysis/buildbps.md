      The FY18-22 Capital Plan funds facility and technology projects that support education and youth 
      achievement in all neighborhoods across the City. Mayor Walsh announced a $1 billion investment 
      to modernize Boston's public school infrastructure, and the 
      <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/buildbps">BuildBPS plan</a> will guide that process.

      <div class="intro-text supporting-text">Through a dedication of City capital funds 
      and a strong working relationship with the 
      <a href="http://www.massschoolbuildings.org/">Massachusetts School Building Authority 
      (MSBA)</a>, the plan will more than double the capital spending on BPS 
      facilities over the next decade. Mayor Walsh’s FY18-22Capital Plan begins to implement 
      early action BuildBPS initiatives while reserving funding for projects coming out of 
      the BuildBPS engagement process.</div>

      <h5>Community involvement</h5>
      <p>A robust community process will commence in FY18 and continue each year. The planning 
      principles, data, and analysis outlined during the BuildBPS planning process will guide 
      community workshops across the City. These workshops will be the vehicle in which the 
      community can propose new projects and investments. The City and BPS will further analyze 
      the proposed projects which will become the foundation of each year’s capital plan.</p>  
      <h5>21st Century Schools Fund</h5>
      <p>The $13 million BuildBPS 21st Century Schools Fund will provide schools with 21st 
      century tools, including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>new technology and comfortable;</li>
      <li>movable furniture to promote learner-centric programs;</li>
      <li>benefit professional development; and</li>
      <li>provide greater flexibility in current and future learning spaces.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Relative to larger-scale building renovations and repairs, these upgrades can be 
      done at lower cost and on an accelerated timeline. BPS will create a menu of 21st 
      century packages that schools will be able to select from depending on their needs. 
      BPS will work with school leaders to complete these upgrades in the 2017-18 school 
      year.</p>
      <h5>Accelerated Repair Program</h5>
      <p>Boston has also successfully ramped up its efforts to leverage 
      <a href="http://www.massschoolbuildings.org/programs/Accelerated_Repair">MSBA Accelerated 
      Repair Program (ARP)</a> dollars to provide much needed improvements to its schools. 
      This summer, Boston will invest $13.6 million to unlock a $16.3 million grant from 
      the MSBA to provide seven BPS schools with new windows. In addition, the MSBA has 
      approved a $6.4 million grant, with Boston providing $3.4 million in matching funds, 
      to replace roofs and boilers at five BPS schools. <blockquote>The Mayor’s Capital 
      Plan sets aside an additional $24 million over five years to position Boston to 
      further leverage MSBA ARP dollars in the future.</blockquote></p>

      <h5>Other BPS projects</h5>
      <ul>
      <li>This Capital Plan allows Boston to invest in BPS projects already 
      in the pipeline: Slated to be completed in winter of 2017/2018, the $73 million 
      <a href="http://dearbornstemacademy.org/">Dearborn STEM Academy</a> 
      will open for students in September 2018. The project,
      which leverages a projected $37 million match from the MSBA, is designed based 
      upon a project-based learning curriculum, with an emphasis on STEM education.</li> 
      <li>Over the next two years, the <a href="https://eliotschool.org/">Eliot School</a> 
      construction projects will be completed. The new $23 million North Bennet 
      Street building will welcome 5th to 8th graders this fall into a 21st century 
      learning environment while this summer, the final phase of construction will 
      begin at the Commercial Street building.</li>
      <li>Renovations will occur at the 
      <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school/mattahunt-elementary-school">Mattahunt 
      Elementary School</a> as it transitions to the Mattapan Early Elementary School.</li>
      <li>The Capital Plan provides for Boston’s matching investment in the 
      <a href="http://bostonpublicschools.org/jqus">Josiah 
      Quincy Upper School (JQUS)</a> and <a href="https://bostonartsacademy.org/">Boston Arts 
      Academy (BAA)</a>, which are collaborative 
      projects with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA). BPS will 
      continue the 5 year plan to upgrade technology infrastructure across the district 
      in support of 21st century learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In total, Boston will invest more than $312 million in BPS capital projects over 
      the next five years, with an additional $418 million committed for the following five 
      years. When combined with projected MSBA matching funds, Boston is committing the $1 
      billion in BPS capital projects over ten years.</p>
