      Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOTs) are payments made by property tax-exempt 
      institutions located in the City, including hospitals, universities, and cultural 
      institutions. These are voluntary contributions for municipal services such 
      as police and fire protection, street cleaning, and snow removal.
    description: >
      Growth in PILOT revenue comes from new agreements, escalations that adjust 
      the payments for inflation, and re-negotiation or expansion of current 
      agreements. The Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort) currently provides 
      over 40% of the PILOT revenue the City receives annually.

      <h5>PILOT background</h5>
      <p>In April 2010, a Mayoral appointed task force released a report suggesting 
      more standardization of PILOT agreements. Specifically, each agreement should 
      represent, in cash or in-kind, 25% of the amount of tax that would be due if 
      properties were not tax exempt. This type of change would generate more revenue 
      than what is currently collected while providing some equity across paying 
      institutions. <blockquote>New agreements under this framework were adopted in 
      FY12 and that year includes the first installment of a five-year phase-in 
      period to the new amounts. FY17 is the first year after that phase-in 
      period.</blockquote></p>

        <h5>Revenue expected to grow</h5>
        <p>Payments in lieu of taxes totaled $49.4 million in FY15 and $51.2 million 
        in FY16. The City expects this revenue source to exceed the $44.5 million budgeted 
        for FY17 and estimates $45.0 million in FY18.</p>
