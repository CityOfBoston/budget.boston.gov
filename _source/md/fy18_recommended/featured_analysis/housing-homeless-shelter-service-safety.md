    short_desc: >
      The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) provides food, shelter and other 
      comprehensive services to over 650 homeless individuals each night at its 
      Woods Mullen and Southampton Street shelters. 
    description: >
      In FY17, the City invested additional resources to enhance service levels at 
      these locations. The investments, which included hiring a mix of coordinators, 
      assistant coordinators, counselors, and security staff, allow BPHC to efficiently
      operate the shelters on a 24/7 basis and to better assist Boston’s most
      vulnerable population with: 
        <ul>
          <li>case management</li>
          <li>medical and behavioral health services</li>
          <li>career counseling</li>
          <li>job training</li>
          <li>substance abuse prevention, and</li>
          <li>housing support.</li>

      <h5>In-depth assessments</h5>
      <p>This funding also allowed for the full implementation of a front door triage 
      system that enables shelter staff to meet with every new guest entering the shelters 
      to conduct an in-depth assessment. This assessment leads to the development of a 
      client-centered plan to exit the shelter system into safe, supported, and stable 
      housing as quickly as possible. </p>

      <h5>Additional resources</h5>
      <p>The FY18 budget reflects Mayor Walsh’s focus to end chronic homelessness in 
      Boston. As a response to federal funding cuts, the City will provide additional 
      resources to BPHC to ensure that the city’s homeless shelters continue to 
      operate 24/7. </p>

      <h5>Rehousing programs</h5>
      <p>Moreover, in recognition of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 
      “Housing First” approach to ending chronic homelessness, the FY18 budget will 
      support rapid rehousing programs that focus on helping households obtain permanent 
      housing as quickly as possible. </p>
