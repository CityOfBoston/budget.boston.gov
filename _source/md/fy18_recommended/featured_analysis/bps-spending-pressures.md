      As mentioned previously, four of the five main drivers that attribute to 
      yearly budgetary challenges at BPS are cost related. BPS spends 45% more per 
      pupil than comparable districts.
    description: >
      This amounts to about $6,400 more per pupil than comparison districts after 
      adjusting for Boston’s higher cost of living.

      This cost can be directly linked to the following occurrences:

  - col: >
      <ul>
        <li>BPS spends nearly five times the average per pupil amount on transportation 
        of the 200 largest districts in the country.</li>
        <li>Boston spends 3.1 times more on transportation costs per Special Education student 
        than comparison districts.  BPS has seen an increased number of students assigned to 
        door-to-do pick-up versus corner bus stop pick-up.</li>
        <li>Due to the size of Boston’s school buildings, BPS’ elementary schools are 140 
        students smaller while their secondary schools are 220 students smaller than peer districts. 
        This causes BPS to spend 35% more per-pupil on school-based administration services.</li>
      </ul>
  - col: >
      <ul>
        <li>20% of BPS students receive special education services compared to the national average 
        of 13%. BPS spends nearly one fourth of its budget on special education, which is 53% 
        greater than the comparison average.</li>
        <li>BPS also pays teachers more than comparison districts on average (adjusted for cost 
        of living). BPS total compensation is 29% higher than the comparison average and 
        the average teacher salary is over $90,000 even before healthcare and pension costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Transportation and special education</h5>
      <p>Not only is BPS spending a large portion of its budget in areas such as transportation 
      and special education, but these areas also see the fastest rate of cost growth. This limits 
      the District’s ability to make substantial investments in other areas.</p>
