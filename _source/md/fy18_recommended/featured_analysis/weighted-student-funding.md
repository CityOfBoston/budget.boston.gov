      <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/Page/1107">Weighted Student Funding 
      (WSF)</a> ensures resource equity for all students no matter the school they attend.
    description: >
      The weighted student funding model creates a baseline per-student 
      funding amount and then adjusts the amount depending on individual student need. 
      For example, students whose family income is at or below the poverty level will 
      receive additional funding.  Other need-based weights include students with 
      disabilities, English Language Learners (ELL), and vocational education students.

        <h5>School budgets</h5>
        <p>A school’s budget is calculated by adding the individual funding amounts for 
        every student projected to attend that school in the fall. Additionally, each school 
        also receives a foundation budget to support essential staff. <blockquote>In FY18, 
        the district increased the total direct appropriations to schools by approximately $2.7 
        million to $483.2 million through WSF.</blockquote></p>
        <p>WSF is only one component of schools’ funding; total school funding is expected 
        to rise by almost 4% or $25 million in FY18. </p>

        <h5>Need-based funding</h5>
        <p>For FY18, the seventh year using the WSF formula, BPS continues to refine 
        this need-based method of funding.  Student-based allocation models are the 
        standard for transparent and equitable school budgeting. Such models allow dollars 
        to follow students, and those dollars are weighted based on student needs. 
        BPS’s highest-need students receive more resources through the weighted 
        student funding structure.</p>
        <h5>Help when enrollment declines</h5>
        <p>When enrollment declines at a school, central office works closely with those 
        schools to appropriately adjust staffing. Particular care was made through this
        process to make classrooms full so that they are affordable to schools. There are 
        safeguards in place to assist schools with a decline in enrollment, including 
        sustainability allocations and soft landings, as well as other reserves that are 
        used throughout the budgeting process. </p>

        <h5>More support for high-need students</h5>
        <p>BPS’s FY18 budget includes a series of substantial supports on top of WSF – including 
        existing and proposed new investments totaling over $16 million – that differentially 
        serve the district’s highest need students. These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the new proposed investment to support students experiencing homelessness;</li>
            <li>state grants for turnaround schools;</li>
            <li>Academic Response Teams; and</li>
            <li>a new $1.25 million reserve specifically targeted at Level 3, 4, and 5 schools.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>These funds will support lower performing schools, and particularly those with declining 
        in enrollment. BPS anticipates significant funds from this reserve will support Excel and 
        Brighton, which are in the turnaround planning process and will see budget increases at 
        the conclusion of that process. </p>
