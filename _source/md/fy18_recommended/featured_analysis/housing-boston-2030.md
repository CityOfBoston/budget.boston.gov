    short_desc: >
      In 2014, Mayor Walsh released Housing a Changing City - Boston 2030, the
      Administration’s comprehensive plan to accommodate Boston's rapid growth 
      and stabilize the housing market over the next 15 years. 
    description: >
      Through the strategies outlined in the plan, more than 19,200 new housing 
      units have already been completed or are currently in construction. 
      This represents 36 percent of the City’s 53,000-unit target for 2030.

      <h5>Inclusionary Development Program</h5>  
      <p>To ensure all Bostonians benefit from Boston’s strong real estate market, 
      in December 2015 Mayor Walsh implemented an executive order to reform the 
      Inclusionary Development Program (IDP). These changes increased the affordable 
      housing contributions required of developers and led to the collection of more 
      than $21 million in IDP revenue to create affordable housing in the last 
      fiscal year alone.</p>
      <h5>Helping long-term residents</h5>
      <p>In addition, as Boston grows, it is important that it grows equitably and 
      prevents the displacement of long-term residents. The Office of Housing Stability 
      was established in FY17 to assist Boston residents experiencing housing crises 
      and to expand the array of anti-displacement services that the City offers. Since 
      July 2014 a total of 2,521 households were able to retain their housing as a result 
      of City services such as foreclosure and eviction prevention.</p>
      <p>In FY18, $75,000 will be invested in the Office of Housing Stability to 
      enhance initiatives, including offering training for both landlords and 
      tenants, developing a tenant orientation guide, and funding families in need 
      of emergency placement.</p>

      <h5>Low-income housing</h5>
      <p>To ensure that residents at all income levels are able to obtain housing that is 
      affordable, the City set a goal of creating 6,500 new units of housing for low-income, 
      non-elderly households.  Currently, the City is running above or near target in both 
      low-income and extremely low-income housing production. <blockquote>Low-income senior 
      housing, currently running at 66 percent of target, is expected to increase substantially 
      in the year ahead due in part to the annual $7.25 million general fund investment 
      in housing.</blockquote></p>
      <p>This includes the City’s first line item for elderly housing production, which Mayor 
      Walsh introduced in FY16. Combining these general fund dollars with federal grants, 
      state grants, and developer fees allows the City to leverage a wide variety of sources 
      to invest in the creation and preservation of affordable housing citywide.</p>

      <h5>Middle-income housing</h5>
      <p>To solve the challenges of creating middle income housing in Boston, Mayor Walsh 
      created the Housing Innovation Lab in 2015, bringing design thinking and innovation 
      to solving these issues.  The lab’s work has led to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>the adoption of Boston’s first density bonus program, which will yield hundreds 
      of privately financed affordable housing units;</li>
      <li>the launch of a compact living development competition on City-owned vacant land; and</li>
      <li>support for an accessory dwelling units policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As grant funding for this program is exhausted, the City will invest $97,500 in general 
      funds to maintain the operation in FY18. The Lab will continue to serve as an internal 
      think tank to develop recommendations to address the City's housing crisis and implement 
      Mayor Walsh’s housing plan.</p>

    body: >
      <p>On November 8th, Boston’s voters approved the adoption of the Community Preservation 
      Act (CPA), a program created by the state of Massachusetts to enhance livability and 
      quality of life in the cities and towns that vote to adopt it. A projected $20 million 
      per year will be used to create affordable housing, preserve open space and historic 
      sites, and develop outdoor recreational opportunities.</p>
      <p>In FY18, a Community Preservation Committee will be established, and will be 
      responsible for making recommendations on CPA projects to the City Council.</p>
