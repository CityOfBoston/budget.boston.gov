      The FY18 Operating Budget and FY18-22 Capital Plan continues to demonstrate 
      Mayor Walsh’s strong commitment to revitalizing branches throughout Boston’s 
      neighborhoods.
    description: >
      Since the Chinatown Branch was torn down in 1954, Chinatown has remained without its 
      own library location. Reestablishing a branch in the neighborhood has been a high priority 
      for members of this community, and under Mayor Walsh’s FY18 budget, library services 
      in the neighborhood will be restored to Chinatown after 54 years. <blockquote>With this 
      reinstitution, the community will have easy access to many valuable services, including 
      a community gathering space, a place for teens and children to study and learn, and
      a location to access critical 21st century services, including internet and 
      computers.</blockquote>

      <h5>Capital Budget funding</h5>
      <p>In FY18, the Mayor’s Capital Budget launches projects for new or renovated spaces 
      at the <a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/uphams.php">Uphams Corner</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/fields.php">Fields Corner</a> branches. It also includes 
      funding for new smaller scale facilities improvement projects, including interior updates at the
      <a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/southend.php">South End</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/lower.php">Lower Mills</a>, and 
      <a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/westroxbury.php">West Roxbury</a> branches, and landscaping and exterior 
      space upgrades at the <a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/southboston.php">South Boston Branch</a>.</p>

      <h5><a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/dudley.php">Dudley Branch</a></h5>
      <p>In FY18, construction will begin at the Dudley Branch. This $14.7 million 
      project includes:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>reorienting the entrance to reconnect it with the heart of Dudley Square;</li>
      <li>interior renovations to improve connections between the building’s spaces; and</li>
      <li>enhanced community and programming space so the branch can better serve the 
      many people who utilize this important resource.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5><a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/roslindale.php">Roslindale</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/adams.php">Adams Street</a></h5>
      <p>The Capital Plan supports design activity at the Roslindale and Adams Street branches 
      in the upcoming year as well. The recently completed programming study and community process 
      for the Adams Street Branch resulted in recommendations for new construction that will 
      expand the building footprint, add new meeting rooms, provide an enhanced teen space, and 
      create redesigned outdoor spaces.</p>
