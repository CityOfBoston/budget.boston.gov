  - title: Implementing Boston’s Homeless Action Plan
    short_desc: >
      With the 2015 publication of Boston’s Way Home, the City’s plan to end chronic 
      and veteran homelessness, Mayor Walsh reinforced the City’s commitment to the 
      most vulnerable populations in our community.
    description: >
      Boston’s Way Home calls for a single, integrated homeless system, which will 
      not only quickly move homeless individuals from Boston's streets and shelters 
      into permanent housing, but also provide them the support they need to 
      remain stable.

      <h5>Increased funding</h5>
      <p>As part of the Boston’s Way Home and Boston Homes for the Brave initiatives, 
      Boston has housed 842 homeless veterans since July 2014, and put an end to chronic 
      veteran homelessness in Boston. In addition, of all major cities in the U.S., 
      Boston has the second lowest rate of unsheltered homeless veterans. <blockquote>To 
      support Boston’s Way Home, Mayor Walsh’s FY18 budget includes an increase of 
      $150,000 in general funds to provide support services for veterans not eligible 
      for VA programs, and an investment of $50,000 in federal funds to modify the 
      City’s Homebuyer Financial Assistance Program to provide down payment 
      assistance to veterans.</blockquote></p>

      <h5>Ending chronic homelessness</h5>
      <p>Because of its commitment to ongoing investments in housing and services, 
      Boston maintains the lowest rate of unsheltered people experiencing homelessness 
      among all major US cities, and the lowest rate of unsheltered homelessness among 
      individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness. Although the City, working with 
      its partners, has been able to house more than 1,000 formerly homeless individuals 
      in the last two years, Boston also serves as a regional hub for services, which 
      continues to increase the need for homeless housing supports. </p>
      <p>Mayor Walsh’s FY18 budget includes more than $25 million in both City and external 
      resources to continue the City’s efforts to end chronic homelessness and provide 
      supportive housing services to formerly homeless individuals.</p>
