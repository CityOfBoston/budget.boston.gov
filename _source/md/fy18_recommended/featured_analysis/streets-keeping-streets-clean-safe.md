      As part of the Mayor’s focus on basic quality of life issues, the FY18 
      budget invests in making sure that city streets in every neighborhood are clean.
    description: >
      To enhance service levels for all of Boston’s neighborhoods, the FY18 budget 
      includes additional resources for the hokey program, where City hokeys (street 
      cleaners) patrol neighborhoods, empty out litter baskets, and pick up trash around 
      the City. <blockquote>This investment will fund an additional six full time hokeys, 
      allowing the department to staff one hokey in each of Boston’s ten Public Works 
      Districts.</blockquote>

      <h5>Clear lane markings</h5>
      <p>To improve safety and expand access to our streets, Boston is launching a citywide, 
      multi-year campaign to bring all crosswalks, lane markings, and bike lanes into a 
      state of good repair. As Boston works to expand access to make Boston's neighborhoods 
      interconnected for all modes of travel, including driving, cycling, and walking, it is 
      important to ensure that our roadways are designed to maximize the safety of such modes 
      of travel. Clear lane markings including crosswalks, "Don't Block the Box" markings 
      at key intersections, and well marked bike lanes with appropriate insignia all help to 
      reduce collisions, making our roadways safer for all users.

      <h5>Repairing sidewalks</h5>
      <p>This FY18 budget builds on past investments in basic city services that have improved 
      quality of life in Boston. As a result of accelerated resurfacing and sidewalk repair in 
      FY17, the percentage of requests for sidewalk repairs addressed on time (within 48 
      hours) increased from 66% in December 2015 to 85% in December 2016.</p>
