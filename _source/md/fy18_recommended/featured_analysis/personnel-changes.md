  - title: FY16 - FY17 FTE Changes
    body: >
      The total net increase in FTEs from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2017 was 165.6. 
      The majority of the growth was in priority areas of Education, Public Safety, and 
      Public Health. The City’s Position Review Committee continued to review all proposed 
      job postings for vacant positions. <blockquote>All hiring was scrutinized and only 
      critical positions were approved. Over 100 long-term vacant positions were eliminated 
      in the FY17 budget.</blockquote>

      <h5>School Department</h5>
      <p>The School Department increased by 35.6 FTEs. The overall number of teachers was 
      fairly stable with a reduction in regular education teachers mostly offset by more inclusion, 
      bilingual, and specialist teachers. The department also saw an increase of 59.6 special 
      education aides in classrooms.</p>
      <h5>Public Safety Cabinet</h5>
      <p>City funded FTEs in the Public Safety Cabinet increased by 45. The Police Department’s 
      increase of 40 is due to the renewed cadet program which started in November 2016. The Fire 
      Department had an increase of 5, due to slightly lower attrition.</p>
      <h5>Mayor’s Office Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Mayor’s Office Cabinet increased by 5.4 FTEs between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2017. 
      The Mayor’s Office increased with the transfer of a position supporting the Education Cabinet, 
      additional support for the Resiliency Office, and Communications staff. The Office of Women’s 
      Advancement declined by 1 FTE with a vacancy, while the Elections Department had an increase 
      of 1 FTE.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Operations Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Operations Cabinet had a net increase of 2 FTEs. Intergovernmental Relations decreased 
      with the transfer of an education position to the Mayor’s Office and a vacancy. In FY17, the 
      newly restructured Public Facilities and Property Management Departments split into separate 
      departments in order to better focus both functions. The net increase across the two departments 
      is due to Public Facilities filling vacancies.</p>
      <h5>Arts and Culture Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Arts and Culture Cabinet declined by 3.1 FTEs with regular attrition in the Library 
      Department. The Economic Development Cabinet increased by 0.9 FTEs with regular vacancies 
      and hiring. In FY17, the Cabinet also had the merger of the Licensing Board into Consumer 
      Affairs and Licensing.</p>
      <h5>Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet increased by 17 FTEs from January 2016 
      to January 2017. The Parks Department grew by 20 due to efforts to ensure parks are safe 
      and clean and active hiring to fill vacancies, while Inspectional Services had a modest 
      decrease of 3 FTEs due to attrition.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Health and Human Services Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Health and Human Services Cabinet shows a net increase of 63.5 FTEs due primarily 
      to targeted investments in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>EMTs;</li>
          <li>Homelessness Services; and</li>
          <li>Addiction Services at the Public Health Commission (total increase of 50.5 FTEs).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The FY16 to FY17 changes at Boston Center for Youth and Families (+6), Boston VETS, 
        and the Commission for Persons with Disabilities related to the filling of vacancies. 
        Fair Housing and Equity increased by 2 FTEs with the appointment of an additional 
        Fair Housing Commission member and a position coming off of a grant to the operating fund.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Other cabinets had minor changes that are reflective of normal attrition and hiring patterns.</p>

  - title: FY18 Projected FTE Changes
    body: >
      The City projects a net increase in FTE levels of 256.9 from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018. 
      The majority of the growth is targeted in the priority areas of education and public safety.
      <blockquote>The City will continue to review the need for hiring into all vacant positions in 
      FY18. Departments eliminated 23 long-term vacant positions in the current budget process.</blockquote>

      <h5>Education Cabinet</h5>
      <p>A significant portion of the projected growth in filled FTEs from January 2017 to January 
      2018 is in the Education Cabinet. This continues the trend of the School Department accounting 
      for the majority of position growth since 2014. In FY18, the School Department is projecting a 
      net annual increase of 130.1 FTEs with higher projections for inclusion teachers and aides, specialist 
      teachers related to the extended learning time (ELT) initiative, and professional support. 
      <blockquote>The department is expanding ELT to 39 additional schools and continues to increase the number
      of inclusion classrooms.</blockquote></p>
      <h5>Public Safety</h5>
      <p>Historically, the number of Public Safety employees on the payroll as of January 1 of any year 
      has fluctuated with the timing of retirements and new classes. In FY18 the Police Department is 
      projected to remain level assuming normal attrition and the hiring of a new class in the summer of 
      2017. The projected increase in the Fire Department is due to 75 firefighters coming off of an expiring 
      SAFER grant. The goal of the department is to have enough firefighters in the suppression force to 
      cover the minimum manning level of 262 and to reduce overtime. A new fire class is planned for the 
      late fall of 2017.</p>
      <h5>Operations Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Operations Cabinet has an increase of 15 primarily due to the BuildBPS transfer of school 
      construction responsibilities from Boston Public Schools to a new school unit at the Public Facilities 
      Department.  The Property Management Department is adding new security positions, which will be 
      funded through 3rd party billing.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Civic Engagement</h5>
      <p>Civic Engagement is projected to have a net increase of 1 FTE.  The Elderly Commission has a 
      slight reduction of 3 FTE due an administrative change for positions with funding split between the 
      City and grants.  Neighborhood Services is adding 4 full time call takers in the Boston311 call center 
      to increase the level of service for Boston residents.</p>
      <h5>Arts and Culture Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Arts and Culture Cabinet will increase by 7 FTEs as the Library Department opens and staffs 
      the newly re-established Chinatown location. The Library is also adding a custodian supervisor 
      at the Copley branch.</p>
      <h5>Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet will see a slight increase with the addition of a 
      position to support Renew Boston Trust and a new preservation assistant to help reduce the wait times 
      for Landmark Commission applications.</p>
      <h5>Administration and Finance Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Administration and Finance Cabinet projects an increase of 1 FTE with a new quality assurance 
      loan management position in the Treasury Department.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Health and Human Services Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Health and Human Services Cabinet will increase by 12 FTEs primarily due to targeted investments 
      in the Public Health Commission’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Addiction Services program. 
      EMS will add EMTs to a Community Assistance Team to respond to non-transport calls in Downtown Boston 
      and the Recovery Road areas. The Public Health Commission will also add 4 FTEs to the PAATHS (Providing 
      Access to Addictions Treatment, Hope and Support) Program to extend hours to evenings and weekends. 
      Additionally, the City will fund Homeless Services positions which were previously covered under 
      federal grants.</p>
      <h5>Information and Technology Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Information and Technology Cabinet is anticipated to grow by 4 FTE. The Department of 
      Innovation and Technology has a capitally funded identity management project that requires additional 
      staff.  A data analytics position will also transfer to the department from the Office of Administration 
      and Finance.</p>
      <h5>Streets Cabinet</h5>
      <p>The Streets Cabinet will increase by 7 FTEs.  The Public Works Department is adding 6 additional 
      full time hokeys (street cleaners) so that each of the 10 Public Works Districts will have regular 
      service from the neighborhood-focused program. The Office of Streets plans to hire a Small Cell/DAS 
      Approval Process Manager to better manage the Street Lighting division and the small cell program.</p>
