    short_desc: >
      Effective debt management ensures that the City can meet its capital infrastructure 
      and facility needs. Debt management requires a series of decisions about the amount, 
      timing, purposes and structure of debt issuance. 
    description: >
       Long-term debt related to capital investment has two main purposes:
         <ol>
           <li>It finances acquisition, construction, repair, and renovation of City-owned 
           buildings and equipment that are necessary to provide public services; and</li>
           <li>It finances infrastructure improvements to ensure the City’s continued 
           growth and safe roadway conditions.</li>

      The Treasury Department manages all borrowings according to the City’s debt management 
      policies. These policies address issues such as debt affordability and limitations on the 
      level of variable rate debt the City will use. The City’s goals are to rapidly repay debt, 
      maintain a conservative level of outstanding debt, and ensure the City’s continued positive 
      financial standing with the bond market.

      <p>Key components of the debt management policies ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>combined net direct debt does not exceed 3% of taxable assessed value;</li>
          <li>at least 40% of the overall debt is repaid within five years and 70% within 
          ten years;</li>
          <li>annual gross debt service costs do not exceed 7% of general fund expenditures; and</li>
          <li>variable rate debt does not exceed 20% of the City’s total currently outstanding 
          bonded debt (the City has no variable debt).</li>
        </ul>
      <p>For further discussion of the City’s financial policies and management controls, refer 
      to the chapter on Financial Management.</p>

      <p>The City’s debt service forecast assumes general obligation borrowing of $173 million 
      in FY18, $177 million in FY19, $200 million in FY20, $200 million in FY21, and $200 million 
      in FY22. On March 7, 2017, the City sold $150 million in general obligation bonds to fund 
      its capital improvement projects.</p>
      <p>The debt tables at the end of this chapter detail the City’s outstanding debt service 
      obligations and demonstrate the City’s rapid retirement of its debt.</p>

      <p><em>Figure 3 – Gross Debt Service as a Percent of Total General Fund Expenditures 
      FY15-FY22</em></p>
      <p>The City’s gross debt service requirement will remain under 7% of total General Fund expenditures 
      through FY22 (See Figure 3).</p>

      <p><em>Figure 4 – Gross Debt Service as a Percent of the Net Property Tax Levy FY15-FY22</em></p>
      <p>The ratio of debt service to the City’s primary revenue source, the property tax levy, is 
      projected to increase through FY22 (See Figure 4). Even with the increase, the ratio is not 
      expected to exceed the City’s policy ceiling.</p>

      <h5>City debt burden</h5>
      <p>The City’s current overall debt burden (net direct debt to assessed property value of 
      $143.58 billion) is approximately 0.91% as of April 30, 2017. The City’s net direct 
      debt per capita currently stands at approximately $1,942 as of April 30, 2017.</p>
      <p>Boston has been conservative about assuming long-term debt and aggressive about retiring 
      debt expeditiously. <blockquote>As of April 30, 2017, the City’s debt retirement schedule shows 
      that 42.7% of its principal will be retired five years out, before the end of FY22 (See the 
      Debt Retirement table at the end of this chapter).</blockquote></p>
      <h5>Credit rating</h5>
      <p>In February of 2017, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s reaffirmed Boston’s 
      credit rating at Aaa, and AAA, respectively. A bond rating is a statement of credit quality 
      and is analyzed when determining the interest rate that should be paid for a municipality’s 
      bonds. A higher bond rating translates into lower interest rates and real dollar savings 
      for the City.</p>
