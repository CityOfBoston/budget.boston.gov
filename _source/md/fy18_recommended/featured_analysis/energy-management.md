      In FY18, department energy budgets total $49.1 million with 
      electricity costs making up 53% of the budget, natural gas costs 
      making up 26% of the budget and gasoline/diesel comprising 9% of 
      the budget. The remaining 12% of the budget funds water and sewer, 
      steam, and heating oil.

      Since 2014, the City has performed 18,551 streetlight LED retrofits. 
      The FY18 Budget reflects an avoidance of 33.6 mWh, or $5.8 million 
      in energy costs, directly attributable to this work.

      <h5>Renew Boston Trust</h5>
      <p>In FY18, the Walsh Administration plans to make energy efficiency 
      improvements to City buildings, under an initiative entitled “Renew Boston 
      Trust”. This initiative aims to bundle municipal energy efficiency renovation 
      projects and capture the resulting financial savings. The City plans to finance 
      the program with general obligation bonds payable with the financial savings 
      resulting from reduced energy consumption. <blockquote>The City expects to implement 
      the program through contracts with energy service companies (ESCOs). The contracts 
      will include performance guarantees to ensure the energy savings produced will 
      sufficiently offset anticipated debt service costs.</blockquote></p>
      <h5>Enterprise Energy Management System</h5>
      <p>The City utilizes a cloud-based Enterprise Energy Management System (“EEMS”) 
      to track and control energy use. EEMS allows the City to monitor and report on the 
      energy consumed by its 314 buildings, other fixed assets, and vehicle fleet. 
      This enables the City to maximize energy savings from opportunities that 
      require real-time feedback, such as electricity peak shaving. The City also 
      utilizes EEMS to meet its public reporting obligations under the Building 
      Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance.</p>
      <h5>Third-party electricity suppliers</h5>
      <p>The City’s electricity requirements have been met by third-party commodity 
      supply contractors since March 2005. To date, the amounts the City has paid to 
      its third-party electricity suppliers have been less than the amounts it would 
      have paid if it had continued to accept default electric service from its 
      local distribution company, Eversource, formerly known as NSTAR – 
      Boston Edison.</p>
