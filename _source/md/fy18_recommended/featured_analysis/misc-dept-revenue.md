      With such limited revenue tools, the City is launching an initiative in the FY18 budget to better maximize local revenue tools. The FY18 budget includes an additional $9.7 million identified in departmental revenues.
    description: >
      In FY18, the Office of Budget Management will initiate revenue audits to verify the accuracy of information reported with certain fees. The City anticipates recovering $2 million in revenue through these audits. This City will also work to maximize federal health insurance reimbursements and address past due bills to recover revenue.
