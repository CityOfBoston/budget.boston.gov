      This year’s budget appropriation of $1.061 billion plus a $20 million collective 
      bargaining reserve bring the total projected budget to $1.081 billion, represents 
      the largest appropriation by the City in the history of BPS. 
    description: >
      The FY18 allocation makes targeted investments in programs that increase academic 
      rigor and enrichments, pre-kindergarten, extended learning time, vocational 
      programming, and resources for students experiencing homelessness.

      <h5>Increased funding</h5>
      <p>Funding directed to schools will increase by almost 4 percent, even before the 
      largest driver of BPS costs, employee collective bargaining increases, are negotiated. 
      When taking into account total spending at schools, funding directed to schools is 
      projected to increase at 96 schools even with flat overall district enrollment. 
      This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>additional funding for lengthening the school day at 39 schools;</li>
          <li>new homeless resources;</li>
          <li>weighted student funding (WSF) allocations;</li>
          <li>a projected allotment from the collective bargaining reserve;</li>
          <li>other supports added to schools after WSF; and</li>
          <li>other new investments.</li>
        </ul>
  - col: >
      <h5>Additional support</h5>
      <p>In addition to school budgets, schools receive support from services that are budgeted 
      centrally. This includes items such as transportation, certain special education 
      services, and facility maintenance. This portion of the budget will increase 2.5% to 
      $308 million. This increase is driven primarily by transportation costs which are expected 
      to rise to $116 million.</p> <blockquote>While transportation costs have risen, BPS expects 
      the $10 million in transportation efficiencies from FY17 to be realized over two 
      years.</blockquote>

    body: >
      <p>As BPS looked to achieve efficiencies to fund strategic investments and approve 
      a balanced budget, they were able to focus the majority of their savings 
      initiatives on central office departments. Overall, the Central Administration budget 
      will decrease by 5.5% to $62 million. The FY18 budget assumes reductions to 
      central office budgets in areas such as stipends, travel, and food.</p>
      <p>The FY18 BPS budget includes the following investments:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>$14.2 million to support an extended day for 15,000 more, from kindergarten 
        through 8th-grade, 120 additional hours of learning time — or the equivalent of 
        20 more school days a year.</li>
        <li>$1.25 million to support Level 3, 4 and 5 schools, particularly those 
        with declining enrollment</li>
        <li>$1.2 million to support more than 3,000 students BPS has identified as
        experiencing homelessness.</li>
        <li>$700 thousand to expand the Excellence for All initiative that increases 
        academic rigor and enrichment to 5th grade.</li>
      </ul>
  - col: >
      <ul>
        <li>$1.3 million for new vocational programming at The English High School and 
        Edward M. Kennedy Academy for Health Careers</li>
        <li>$500 thousand for an additional 100 K1 seats.</li>
        <li>$340 thousand investment to support the District’s water policy.</li>
        <li>$275 thousand for additional substitute custodians.</li>
        <li>$81 thousand to open new dual language classrooms.</li>
      </ul>

  - title: Collective bargaining agreements
    body: >
      Like most City departments, Boston Public Schools has not yet negotiated their collective 
      bargaining agreements effective in FY18. Consequently, this budget does not include 
      general wage increase for FY18. The City will reserve $20 million to support BPS to 
      be used when agreements are negotiated.
