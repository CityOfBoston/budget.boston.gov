      On the expenditure side, the FY18 budget reflects an increase of $144 million or 
      4.8% over the FY17 budget.  Of that growth, 40% is dedicated to education (including 
      Boston Public Schools and Charter School Tuition Assessment), 38% will go to all other 
      City Services (such as Police, Fire, and Public Works) and the Public Health 
      Commission, and the remaining 22% of growth will be consumed by pension, debt service 
      and other fixed cost expenditures.

  - title: Overview
    body: >
      <p>On the expenditure side of the budget, total appropriations increase 
      by $94.1 million or 4.0% and fixed costs increase by $49.6 million or 
      8.0%. Selected FY18 budgeted appropriations compare with FY17 budgeted 
      appropriations as follows: City Appropriations increase $32.0 million or 
      2.7%; the Boston Public Health Commission increases by $1.8 million or 
      2.3%; and the School Department increases $29.2 million or 2.8%. In 
      addition, collective bargaining reserves are set aside for the School 
      Department at $20 million and City Departments at $27 million; when 
      collective bargaining agreements are negotiated, these reserves will be 
      used to cover those increased costs. Within City Appropriations, actual 
      City Departments are increasing by $25.6 million or 2.7% over FY17. These 
      departmental increases are low relative to other years due to the 
      expiration of nearly all collective bargaining agreements, 11 central 
      appropriations, including a large  appropriation for Health Insurance 
      totaling $216.9 million which is increasing by $10.6 million or 5.2% and 
      is also included within City Appropriations.</p>
      <p>FY18 budgeted fixed costs are increasing by $49.6 million and compare 
      with FY17 budgeted fixed costs as follows: Pensions increase $18.9 million 
      or 9.5%; Debt Service increases $10.6 million or 6.1%; Charter School 
      Tuition state assessment increases $17.5 million or 11.2%; MBTA state 
      assessment increases by $0.8 million or 1.0%; and other state assessments 
      increases $69 thousand or 1.5%.</p>

  - title: Expenditures
    body: >
      Expenditures are broken down into two primary groups: (1) appropriations 
      directly related to departmental services and (2) fixed and mandated costs. 
      FY18 appropriations are subdivided into three subgroups as follows:
      <ul>
      <li>City Appropriations, which includes all operating department 
      appropriations, centrally budgeted costs such as health insurance and 
      Medicare, a risk retention reserve and a set-aside for tax title and annual 
      audit expenses;</li>
      <li>Boston Public Health Commission (PHC), the City appropriation for the 
      quasi-independent authority and successor to the Department of Health and 
      Hospitals;</li>
      <li>and School Department, the City appropriation for the Boston Public 
      Schools (BPS).</li>
      </ul>
      Appropriations are also presented by expenditure category across the three 
      subgroups.
      <br /><br />
      Personnel Services include salaries, overtime, unemployment compensation 
      and workers’ compensation, and collective bargaining reserves for estimated 
      wage increases for union employees whose agreements are not settled. Most 
      of the City’s collective bargaining agreements expired in FY17.
      <br /><br />
      Negotiations for successor agreements are ongoing. Avoiding arbitration, 
      the City and the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association agreed to a new 
      contract through June 30, 2020.  The agreement includes annual general 
      wage increases of 2%, other benefit enhancements, and full restoration of 
      Quinn Bill benefits reduced by the State in 2009.
      <br /><br />
      The Health Benefits category includes the cost of health, dental and life 
      insurance for City, BPS and PHC employees and retirees, employer Medicare 
      payroll taxes, and the appropriation for Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB).
      <br /><br />
      The Contractual Services category includes expenditures for communications, 
      repairs and service to buildings, equipment and vehicles, transportation, 
      trash collection and disposal, as well as outside legal, advertising, and 
      printing expenses.
      <br /><br />
      Included in the “Other” category are supplies and materials such as gasoline, 
      uniform allowances, office supplies, workers’ compensation medical expenses, 
      medical indemnification in the Fire and Police Departments, legal liabilities, 
      and aid to veterans. Also included in the “Other” category are appropriations 
      for equipment, vehicles, a risk retention reserve, the Housing Trust Fund, 
      tax title, and funding for the City’s outside audit.
