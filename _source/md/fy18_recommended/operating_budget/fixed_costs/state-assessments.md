      Accompanying the local aid distributions on the State’s Cherry Sheet are charges to the City from the Commonwealth. The City expects to be assessed $264.9 million by the Commonwealth in FY18, $19.0 million over the previous year.
    description: >
      Aside from the assessments for <a href="https://budget.boston.gov/operating-budget/charter-school-tuition">Charter School Tuition</a> and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) state assessment growth is relatively small. In accordance with Proposition 2 1/2, these charges, except for Charter School Tuition, cannot increase by more than 2.5% annually on a statewide basis.
