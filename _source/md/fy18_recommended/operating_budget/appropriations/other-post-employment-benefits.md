    short_desc: >
      Similar to pensions, employees earn post-employment health 
      care and life insurance benefits (OPEB) over their years of 
      active service, with those benefits being received 
      during retirement.
    description: >
      The City, including the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC), 
      has an unfunded liability for these benefits of $2.26 billion, as 
      of the most recent independent actuarial valuation on June 30, 2015. 
      <blockquote>The size of this liability is largely influenced by changes 
      to retiree health benefits, the City’s annual additional contribution 
      to fund the liability, and the discount rate assumed.</blockquote>

      <h5>Voluntary annual allocations</h5>
      <p> While the City is required by law to make an annual contribution 
      toward reducing its unfunded pension liability, there is no such requirement 
      for retiree health and life insurance benefits. In FY08, the City followed 
      new Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) requirements to identify 
      and disclose this estimated liability, and also began voluntary annual 
      allocations to fund the liability. Annual allocations are retained in an 
      irrevocable Trust Fund, authorized through the City’s acceptance of M.G.L. 
      Chapter 32B section 20. As of December 31, 2016 the Fund had a balance 
      of $437 million.</p>
      <h5>Reducing liability</h5>
      <p>This budget again dedicates $40 million toward reducing the City’s long 
      term other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liability. These fiscally responsible 
      actions are critical to the Walsh Administration’s prudent financial management 
      policies, which have contributed to the recent affirmation of Boston’s triple 
      A bond rating.</p>
  - col: >
      <h5>Annual Required Contribution</h5>
      <p>The Annual Required Contribution (ARC) for the City to significantly reduce 
      the OPEB liability over a 30 year period is projected at $184.9 million in FY18, 
      as shown in Table 4. $172.2 million (93%) of this amount will be funded through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a combination of pay-as-you-go benefit payments for current retirees 
          (included in health care costs discussed in previous section);</li>
          <li>a $40 million FY18 allocation by the City to the Trust; and</li>
          <li>an additional $2.25 million deposit by the BPHC into the Trust.</li>
        </ul>
      <h5>Funding the OPEB liability</h5>
      <p>As discussed later, the City is on track to fully fund its pension liability 
      in 2025. The City then plans to redirect previous annual pension contributions 
      to further reduce the unfunded OPEB liability, with a goal of fully funding 
      the OPEB liability in 30 years.</p>
