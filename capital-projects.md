  - title: What Are "Capital" Projects?
    body: >
      The City is responsible for maintaining a large
      inventory of capital assets, including roads, bridges,
      schools, parks, libraries, public safety equipment, city
      buildings and more. The City’s capital investments
      enhance our neighborhoods, improve mobility, support
      the academic agenda of our schools and reinforce
      public safety with quality emergency response tools.
      <br /><br />
      These capital investments are planned and funded
      through the City’s capital budget, which is separate
      and distinct from the annual operating budget, as the
      capital plan is primarily funded by borrowing through
      the issuance of bonds within the City’s fiscally
      responsible debt affordability limits.

  - title: Imagine Boston 2030
    body: >
      Imagine Boston 2030, the City’s first comprehensive
      planning process in fifty years is underway. Four goals
      have emerged that will help guide Boston’s growth:
      <ul>
      <li>Provide quality of life in accessible
      neighborhoods.</li>
      <li>Drive inclusive economic growth.</li>
      <li>Invest in infrastructure, open space and
      culture.</li>
      <li>Promote a healthy environment and adapt to climate changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      The City’s capital plan is an important tool in realizing
      the goals and vision of Boston 2030. As an investment
      program for the future, “Building A Better Boston” will
      enable the City to identify, prioritize, and implement
      capital projects aligned with Boston 2030’s goals.
      <br /><br />
      The FY17-FY21 capital plan initiates early action items
      from completed plans, reserves funding capacity for
      future projects that will emerge from ongoing planning
      processes such as Build BPS – the 10-year facilities
      master plan for Boston Public Schools, and embraces a
      new model for implementing and financing energy
      efficiency projects.
      <br /><br />
      This capital plan makes new investments in the City’s
      parks, libraries, streets, and other infrastructure.
      These new investments are possible due to a
      reevaluation of all future projects relative to
      immediate need, increasing annual borrowing within
      the City’s debt affordability policy, utilizing the
      Parking Meter Fund to support a portion of the
      Northern Avenue Bridge project, and applying the
      City’s one-time FY16 snow surplus toward one-time
      capital projects.
      <br /><br />
      The FY17-21 capital plan includes 327 projects that
      will keep Boston healthy, thriving, and innovative
      through investments in education, public safety,
      parks, transportation, and community spaces.

  - title: FY17 Expenditures Allocation
    body: >
      The City estimates FY17 capital expenditures will total
      $267 million from all sources (see Figure 2).
      <br /><br />
      All projects in the capital plan are categorized as
      Upkeep, New/Major Renovation, Upgrade, Planning or
      Matching Funds. OBM tracks the overall distribution
      of these categories to maintain a balance between the
      upkeep of existing assets and the expansion or
      introduction of new ones.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Upkeep:</strong> Upkeep represents projects that maintain the
      City’s assets, a fundamental priority of the Capital
      Plan. In FY17, 33% of projected spending supports
      Upkeep projects. These include roof and masonry
      repairs, the replacement of play equipment in parks,
      HVAC and boiler replacement, and critical repair
      funds for departments to address relatively small but
      vital repair projects not covered by routine
      maintenance. A substantial portion of the Upkeep
      category supports on-going bridge, street, sidewalk,
      and street lighting repairs that ensure the City’s roads
      and sidewalks are safe and in good condition.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Upgrade:</strong> Upgrade represents projects that improve
      existing assets by adding new capacity or innovations.
      This year’s upgrade allocations account for 41% of
      projected spending, and includes projects such as
      Connect Historic Boston – the redesign of several
      Downtown streets with support from a Federal grant –
      and new equipment for the police radio system. 
      <br /><br />
      <strong>New/Major Renovation:</strong> 24% of the FY17 allocations
      represent major renovations and new buildings. New
      facilities and rehabilitation projects for schools,
      libraries, parks and community centers enable the
      City’s facilities to adapt to fit the needs of today’s
      programs, improve the ‘green’ performance of
      facilities, and extend the useful life of older assets.
      Highlights in this category include a new fire houses at
      Engine 42 in Roxbury and a new library in Dorchester.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Planning or Matching Funds:</strong> About 4% of the FY17
      budget is assigned to matching fund requirements and
      to planning projects. Comprehensive planning
      projects, which analyze a group of buildings or
      program needs, provide the groundwork for targeted
      investments in the categories of Upgrade and
      New/Major Renovations. Projects in this category
      include the 10-year master plan for school facilities, a
      programming study to determine the space needs for
      modern fire stations, and planning money for the
      construction of a new North Washington Street bridge,
      which will help leverage state construction funds.
