     The reserve is a "just in case" fund.
   description: >
     The Reserve budget is a fixed cost stipulated by state law and requires the City of Boston to maintain a reserve on its balance sheet of 2.5% of the prior year appropriations, not including the School Department. The current balance of this reserve is $30.6 million and the City is required to budget $740,000 in FY17 to meet reserve requirements. The reserve can be used to provide for extraordinary and unforeseen expenditures and the Mayor may make drafts or transfers against this fund with City Council approval after June first of each fiscal year. Since the establishment of this reserve, the City has yet to make any drafts or transfers from the reserve.
