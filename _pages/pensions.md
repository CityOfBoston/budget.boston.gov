     Boston’s Pensions budget is one of Boston’s fixed costs based on the current pension schedule approved by Boston’s Retirement Board.
   description: >
     The City of Boston participates in a contributory defined benefit retirement system that is administered by the Boston Retirement System (BRS). BRS is one of 106 public pension systems governed by Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32. Boston’s current pension schedule based on an actuarial asset valuation as of January 1, 2014 with updated mortality tables. The current pension schedule assumes a long term rate of return of 7.75%. The City’s pension liability is currently 70.2% funded and is on track to reduce the unfunded liability to zero by 2025, fifteen years prior to the legally required funding date of 2040.

     In FY17 Boston, working collaboratively with the Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC), will restructure their pension schedules to more accurately reflect split service between the two entities. Now that the two entities have been separated for almost forty years, the number of retirees with split service in both entities continues to grow smaller over the years. It now makes sense for BWSC to directly support its own pension schedule and then seek reimbursement from Boston for the remaining retirees with split service. This will result in savings for the City of Boston in its main Pension budget included in fixed costs but will require an increase to its pay-as-you-go Pension and Annuities appropriation of $1.2 million. This restructuring will achieve an overall net savings to the City of Boston an estimated $4.7 million. The Pensions and Annuities budget is used to fund retiree split service payments and retirees that predate the BRS contributory retirement system and public safety retirees that have been granted line of duty death benefits or retirements based on special acts of the Massachusetts legislature due to extreme workplace injuries.
